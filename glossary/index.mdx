## A

### Ad Set (Ad Group)
**A container for your ads that defines who sees them.** Each ad set has its own targeting, budget, and schedule. Think of it like: "Show these specific ads to this specific group of people."

### Attribution
**Figuring out which ad led to an install or action.** When someone installs your app, attribution tells you: "They came from your Instagram ad targeting fitness fans." See [Tracking & Attribution](/concepts/tracking-and-attribution).

### ATT (App Tracking Transparency)
**Apple's permission popup that asks users if they want to be tracked.** Since iOS 14.5, apps must ask before tracking. About 25-35% of users say yes.

### ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)
**How much money each user makes you, on average.** Formula: Total Revenue ÷ Number of Users. If you made $1,000 from 500 users, your ARPU is $2.

## B

### Bid
**The amount you're willing to pay for a result (click, install, etc.) in the ad auction.** Higher bids = more likely to win the auction, but more expensive. See [Bidding & Budget](/concepts/bidding-and-budget).

### Bounce Rate
**The percentage of people who click your ad but leave immediately without doing anything.** High bounce rate = your landing page or App Store listing isn't matching what the ad promised.

## C

### Campaign
**The top level of ad organization.** Contains your goal (installs, clicks) and overall budget. Everything else (ad sets, ads) lives inside it. See [Campaign Structure](/concepts/campaign-structure).

### CPA (Cost Per Action/Acquisition)
**How much you pay for a specific action** (registration, purchase, etc.). Formula: Total Spend ÷ Number of Actions. If you spent $100 and got 20 registrations, CPA = $5.

### CPC (Cost Per Click)
**How much you pay each time someone clicks your ad.** Formula: Total Spend ÷ Clicks. A CPC of $0.50 means each click costs you fifty cents.

### CPI (Cost Per Install)
**How much you pay for each app install.** The single most important metric for app developers. Formula: Total Spend ÷ Installs. If you spent $100 and got 50 installs, CPI = $2.

### CPM (Cost Per Mille/Thousand)
**How much you pay per 1,000 ad impressions (views).** Formula: (Total Spend ÷ Impressions) × 1,000. A CPM of $10 means you pay $10 for every 1,000 people who see your ad.

### Creative
**The actual visual content of your ad** — the image, video, text, and call-to-action button. The single biggest factor in ad performance. See [Creatives](/concepts/creatives).

### CTR (Click-Through Rate)
**The percentage of people who see your ad and click it.** Formula: Clicks ÷ Impressions × 100. A 2% CTR means 2 out of every 100 people who see your ad click it. Higher = better.

### Conversion
**When a user does the thing you wanted** — installs your app, signs up, makes a purchase. The definition depends on what you're optimizing for.

### Conversion Rate
**The percentage of clicks that lead to a conversion.** Formula: Conversions ÷ Clicks × 100. If 100 people click and 10 install, your conversion rate is 10%.

## D

### Daily Budget
**The maximum amount you'll spend per day on a campaign or ad set.** Set it to $15/day and the platform won't spend more than ~$15 in a day (sometimes slightly more, balanced over the week).

### Deep Link
**A URL that opens a specific screen in your app** (not just the home screen). Used in ads to take users directly to relevant content after installing.

## F

### Frequency
**How many times the same person sees your ad, on average.** A frequency of 3 means each person saw your ad 3 times. Over 3-4 = people are getting annoyed (ad fatigue).

### Funnel
**The journey from seeing an ad to becoming a user.** Impression → Click → App Store → Install → Open → Register → Purchase. Each step has drop-off.

## I

### Impressions
**The number of times your ad was shown.** One person seeing your ad 3 times = 3 impressions. Not the same as reach (unique people).

### Install (as a metric)
**When someone downloads and opens your app for the first time.** This is typically what you're paying for with app install campaigns.

## L

### Landing Page
**The page someone sees after clicking your ad.** For app ads, this is usually your App Store / Play Store listing.

### Lookalike Audience
**An audience the platform creates based on your existing users.** You give Meta your best 1,000 users, and it finds 1 million more people who "look like" them. Very powerful once you have enough data.

### LTV (Lifetime Value)
**The total revenue a user generates over their entire time using your app.** The holy grail metric. If your LTV > CPI, you're making money.

## M

### MMP (Mobile Measurement Partner)
**A third-party tool that tracks which ads drive installs across all platforms.** Examples: AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch. See [Tracking & Attribution](/concepts/tracking-and-attribution).

## O

### Optimization Event
**The action you tell the platform to optimize for.** If you choose "App Installs," the platform finds people most likely to install. If you choose "Purchase," it finds people most likely to buy.

## P

### Pixel
**A piece of code on your website that tracks visitor behavior.** For apps, the equivalent is the SDK. Sends data back to the ad platform.

### Placement
**Where your ad appears.** Instagram Feed, Facebook Stories, Google Search Results, TikTok For You page, etc. Each placement has different specs and performance.

## R

### Reach
**The number of unique people who saw your ad.** Different from impressions: if 1,000 people each saw your ad twice, reach = 1,000 but impressions = 2,000.

### Retargeting (Remarketing)
**Showing ads to people who already interacted with you** — visited your website, opened your app, added to cart but didn't buy. Usually high conversion rate. See [Retargeting](/playbook/retargeting).

### ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)
**How much revenue you earn for each dollar spent on ads.** Formula: Revenue ÷ Ad Spend. A ROAS of 3x means you make $3 for every $1 you spend. ROAS > 1 = profitable.

## S

### SDK (Software Development Kit)
**Code you add to your app to enable tracking, analytics, or features.** Meta SDK, Firebase SDK, etc. Required for proper ad tracking.

### SKAN (SKAdNetwork)
**Apple's privacy-friendly attribution framework.** Provides limited conversion data without revealing individual user identity. Introduced with iOS 14.5.

### Split Test (A/B Test)
**Running two versions of something to see which performs better.** Different ad image? Different audience? Different headline? Test them against each other with real data.

## T

### Targeting
**Defining who should see your ads.** Based on demographics, interests, behaviors, keywords, or custom audiences. See [Targeting](/concepts/targeting).

## U

### UAC (Universal App Campaign)
**Google's automated app install campaign type.** You provide assets, Google distributes them across Search, Play, YouTube, and Display. Now called "App campaigns."

### UGC (User Generated Content)
**Content created by real people (not brands).** UGC-style ads look authentic and often outperform polished branded content, especially on TikTok and Instagram.
