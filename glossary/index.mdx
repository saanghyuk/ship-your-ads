# Ad Glossary A-Z

## How to use this glossary

Found a term you do not understand? Search for it here (Ctrl/Cmd + K also works).
Every term is explained in plain English -- no jargon, no fluff. If a term has a formula, we show you how to calculate it with a real example.

This glossary covers 90+ terms across ad buying, attribution, analytics, privacy, and campaign management.

<Tip>
**Bookmark this page.** You will come back to it often. As you read guides on this site or work with ad platforms, use this as your quick reference whenever you encounter unfamiliar terminology. If you are brand new to advertising, start by reading the entries for CPI, CPM, CPC, ROAS, and LTV -- these are the five metrics you will see most often.

## A

### A/B Test (Split Test)

**Running two versions of something to see which one performs better.** You show version A to half the people and version B to the other half, then compare results with real data. The winner gets more budget. For example, you might test two different ad images to see which one gets more installs.

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: For an A/B test to be meaningful, you need enough data. A general rule of thumb: wait until each version has at least 1,000 impressions and 30+ conversions before drawing conclusions. Anything less and you might be seeing random noise, not a real difference.
</Tip>

### Ad Exchange

**A digital marketplace where advertisers and publishers buy and sell ad space in real-time auctions.** Think of it like a stock exchange, but for ads instead of stocks. Every time a user opens an app or loads a webpage, an auction happens in milliseconds to decide which ad to show. Google Ad Exchange (AdX) is the largest one. See [Programmatic Advertising](/adtech/programmatic) for more details.

### Ad Network

**A company that connects advertisers with publishers (apps and websites that show ads).** The ad network aggregates ad inventory from many publishers and sells it to advertisers. Examples include Google Display Network, Meta Audience Network, and Unity Ads. Ad networks sit between the advertiser and the publisher, taking a cut of the revenue. See [Ad Servers & Ad Networks](/adtech/ad-servers-and-networks) for the full story.

### Ad Server

**The technology that stores ads and decides which ad to show to which user at which moment.** It also tracks impressions, clicks, and conversions. Think of it as the traffic controller of the advertising world. Google Ad Manager is the most widely used ad server.

### Ad Set (Ad Group)

**A container for your ads that defines who sees them.** Each ad set has its own targeting, budget, and schedule. Think of it like: "Show these specific ads to this specific group of people." Meta calls them "ad sets," Google calls them "ad groups" -- same concept, different name.

### ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)

**How much money each user makes you, on average.** Formula: Total Revenue / Number of Users. If you made $1,000 from 500 users, your ARPU is $2. Track ARPU over different time windows (Day 7, Day 30, Day 90) to understand how user value grows over time.

### Attribution

**Figuring out which ad led to an install or action.** When someone installs your app, attribution tells you: "They came from your Instagram ad targeting fitness fans." Without attribution, you would have no idea which of your ads are actually working. See [Attribution Deep Dive](/adtech/attribution-deep-dive) for the complete technical guide.

### Attribution Window

**The time period after a user clicks or views an ad during which a conversion can be credited to that ad.** A 7-day click attribution window means if a user clicks your ad on Monday and installs on Thursday, the install is credited to the ad. If they install the following Tuesday (8 days later), it is not.

Different platforms offer different window options -- choosing the right one affects how many conversions you see in your reports.

### ATT (App Tracking Transparency)

**Apple's permission popup that asks users if they want to be tracked across apps and websites.** Since iOS 14.5, apps must ask before accessing the IDFA for tracking. About 20-25% of users say yes. If a user says no, ad platforms fall back to SKAdNetwork for limited attribution data. This single change cost Meta approximately $10 billion in 2022 revenue.

### Audience Network

**A feature offered by Meta that lets your ads appear in third-party apps and websites, not just Facebook and Instagram.** It extends your reach beyond Meta's own platforms. Audience Network placements are usually cheaper but can have lower quality.

---

## B

### Bid

**The amount you are willing to pay for a result (click, install, purchase, etc.) in the ad auction.** Higher bids mean you are more likely to win the auction, but you pay more per result. Most platforms use automated bidding by default, but you can set manual bids for more control.

### Bid Cap

**A bidding strategy where you set the maximum amount you are willing to pay per result.** The platform will never bid above this amount in any individual auction. Use it when you have a strict CPA target you absolutely cannot exceed.

The tradeoff is that you may get fewer results because the platform cannot bid above your cap even when higher bids would win valuable auctions.

### Bounce Rate

**The percentage of people who click your ad but leave immediately without doing anything meaningful.** A high bounce rate usually means your landing page or App Store listing is not matching what the ad promised. If your ad shows a fitness app but the App Store listing looks like a meditation app, people will bounce.

### Broad Match

**A keyword match type in Google Ads and Apple Search Ads where your ad shows for searches related to your keyword, even if the exact words are not used.** "fitness app" in broad match might trigger your ad for "best workout tracker," "exercise program," or "health and wellness apps." It gives the widest reach but the least control over which searches trigger your ad.

---

## C

### CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)

**The total cost of acquiring a new paying customer, including all marketing and sales expenses.** Similar to CPA but specifically refers to customers who actually pay you money. Formula: Total Marketing Spend / Number of New Paying Customers. If you spend $5,000 on ads and get 100 new paying users, your CAC is $50.

### Campaign

**The top level of ad organization on any platform.** A campaign contains your objective (installs, clicks, conversions), overall budget, and strategy settings. Everything else -- ad sets/groups, ads, and creatives -- lives inside the campaign.

### CBO (Campaign Budget Optimization)

**A Meta Ads feature that automatically distributes your campaign budget across ad sets based on real-time performance.** Instead of setting a separate budget for each ad set, you set one budget at the campaign level and let Meta's algorithm decide where to spend it. This generally performs better than manually allocating budgets.

### Click-Through Rate (CTR)

**The percentage of people who see your ad and click it.** Formula: Clicks / Impressions x 100. A 2% CTR means 2 out of every 100 people who see your ad click it. Higher CTR generally means your ad creative is relevant and compelling.

Typical CTRs vary by platform: Facebook feed ads average 0.9-1.5%, Google Search ads average 3-6%, and TikTok ads average 0.5-1.5%.

### Conversion

**When a user does the thing you wanted -- installs your app, signs up, makes a purchase, starts a trial.** The definition of "conversion" depends entirely on what you are optimizing for. One campaign might define conversion as an install, while another defines it as a purchase.

### Conversion Rate

**The percentage of clicks that lead to a conversion.** Formula: Conversions / Clicks x 100. If 100 people click your ad and 10 install your app, your conversion rate is 10%. Higher conversion rates mean your ad-to-app-store experience is working well.

### Cost Cap

**A bidding strategy in Meta Ads where you set the average cost per result you want to achieve.** The platform tries to get as many results as possible at or below your cost cap. It is more flexible than bid cap because individual results can cost more or less -- as long as the average stays near your target.

### CPA (Cost Per Action/Acquisition)

**How much you pay for a specific action -- a registration, purchase, subscription start, or any other event you define.** Formula: Total Spend / Number of Actions. If you spent $100 and got 20 registrations, your CPA is $5. CPA is the most meaningful cost metric because it measures what you actually care about.

### CPC (Cost Per Click)

**How much you pay each time someone clicks your ad.** Formula: Total Spend / Clicks. A CPC of $0.50 means each click costs you fifty cents. CPC is the standard pricing model for search ads (Google Ads, Apple Search Ads).

### CPCV (Cost Per Completed View)

**How much you pay for each completed video view.** A "completed view" is usually defined as watching 100% of the video (for short videos under 15 seconds) or watching at least 15-30 seconds (for longer videos). This metric helps you understand the true cost of getting someone to watch your entire video ad.

### CPI (Cost Per Install)

**How much you pay for each app install.** The single most important cost metric for app developers. Formula: Total Spend / Installs. If you spent $100 and got 50 installs, your CPI is $2.

CPI varies dramatically by country, platform, and app category -- from $0.50 in some developing markets to $5+ in the US for competitive categories.

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: CPI alone does not tell you if your campaign is profitable. A $5 CPI campaign that acquires users with $20 LTV is far better than a $1 CPI campaign that acquires users with $0.50 LTV. Always evaluate CPI alongside LTV and ROAS.
</Tip>

### CPM (Cost Per Mille/Thousand)

**How much you pay per 1,000 ad impressions (views).** "Mille" is Latin for thousand. Formula: (Total Spend / Impressions) x 1,000. A CPM of $10 means you pay $10 for every 1,000 times your ad is shown. CPM is the standard pricing model for social media ads (Meta, TikTok) and display ads.

### Creative

**The actual visual content of your ad -- the image, video, text, headline, and call-to-action button.** Creative is the single biggest factor in ad performance. Great targeting with a bad creative will fail; mediocre targeting with a great creative can succeed.

### Custom Audience

**An audience you create from your own data -- email lists, phone numbers, app user IDs, website visitors, or people who engaged with your social content.** You upload or connect this data to the ad platform, which matches it to user profiles. Custom audiences are the foundation for retargeting campaigns and for creating lookalike audiences.

---

## D

### Daily Budget

**The maximum amount you will spend per day on a campaign or ad set.** Set it to $15/day and the platform will not spend more than approximately $15 in a day. Platforms may occasionally overspend by up to 25% on high-performing days, but they balance it by underspending on other days so your weekly total stays on track.

### DDA (Data-Driven Attribution)

**An attribution model that uses machine learning to determine how much credit each touchpoint deserves for a conversion.** Unlike simple last-click attribution, DDA considers the entire user journey and assigns credit proportionally. Available in Google Ads and GA4. Google recommends DDA as the default model for most advertisers.

### Deep Link

**A URL that opens a specific screen in your app rather than just the home screen.** When used in ads, deep links take users directly to relevant content after installing. For example, if your ad promotes a specific product, a deep link opens that product page.

Deferred deep links work even for new installs -- the user is routed to the right screen after downloading and opening the app for the first time.

### Demand-Side Platform (DSP)

**Software that advertisers use to buy ad placements programmatically across many websites and apps in real-time.** Think of it as a control center for buying ads at scale. Examples: Google DV360, The Trade Desk, Amazon DSP. DSPs connect to ad exchanges to bid on individual impressions as they become available. See [Programmatic Advertising](/adtech/programmatic).

### Device ID

**A unique identifier assigned to a mobile device, used for ad tracking and attribution.** On iOS this is the IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers); on Android it is the GAID (Google Advertising ID). Both are resettable by users and can be opted out of. Device IDs are how ad platforms connect an ad click to an app install on the same device.

### DMP (Data Management Platform)

**A platform that collects, organizes, and activates audience data from multiple sources.** DMPs handle first-party data (your own), second-party data (from partners), and third-party data (purchased from data providers). They are becoming less relevant as third-party cookies and device IDs become harder to access. See [Targeting Technology](/adtech/targeting-deep-dive).

### Dynamic Creative

**A feature in Meta Ads that automatically tests different combinations of your creative elements.** You provide multiple images, videos, headlines, descriptions, and CTAs, and the platform mixes and matches them to find the best-performing combinations for each audience segment. This saves you from manually creating dozens of ad variations.

---

## E

### eCPM (Effective Cost Per Mille)

**The effective cost per 1,000 impressions, calculated after the fact regardless of the actual pricing model used.** This lets you compare performance across campaigns using different pricing models (CPC, CPA, CPM). Formula: (Total Spend / Total Impressions) x 1,000.

### Event

**A specific user action tracked by your analytics or ad platform SDK.** Examples: app open, sign-up, purchase, level complete, add to cart, start trial. Events are the foundation of conversion tracking, optimization, and analytics. See the [SDK Integration Guide](/playbook/sdk-integration) for a cross-platform event name mapping.

### Exact Match

**A keyword match type in Google Ads and Apple Search Ads where your ad only shows when someone searches for your exact keyword or very close variants.** "fitness app" in exact match triggers for "fitness app," "fitness apps," and "app for fitness" -- but not for "workout tracker" or "health app." It gives the most control but reaches the fewest people.

---

## F

### First-Party Data

**Data you collect directly from your own users -- their in-app behavior, purchase history, email addresses, demographics, and preferences.** This is the most valuable and privacy-safe data you have because you collected it with user consent. As third-party cookies and device IDs become harder to access, first-party data is increasingly important. See [Fraud & Privacy](/adtech/fraud-and-privacy) for why this matters.

### Frequency

**How many times the same person sees your ad, on average.** A frequency of 3 means each person in your audience saw your ad 3 times on average. Frequency above 3-4 usually signals ad fatigue -- people have seen it too many times and start ignoring or disliking it, which drives up costs.

### Frequency Cap

**A limit you set on how many times the same person can see your ad within a given time period.** For example, "no more than 3 impressions per person per week." Frequency caps prevent ad fatigue while still allowing enough exposure for your message to be effective. Not all campaign types support frequency caps.

### Funnel

**The journey a person takes from first seeing your ad to becoming a paying user.** A typical app funnel: Ad Impression --> Ad Click --> App Store View --> Install --> First Open --> Registration --> Key Action --> Purchase. Each step has drop-off -- understanding where users drop off helps you fix bottlenecks.

---

## G

### GAID (Google Advertising ID)

**The advertising identifier for Android devices.** It serves the same purpose as Apple's IDFA -- it lets ad platforms track and attribute user actions to specific ads. Unlike IDFA, GAID is still relatively accessible on Android, though Google is gradually introducing more privacy restrictions through the Privacy Sandbox initiative.

### Geo-Targeting

**Targeting ads to users based on their geographic location -- country, state/region, city, postal code, or a radius around a point.** For example, showing ads only to users in the United States, or only to users within 10 miles of New York City. Geo-targeting matters because CPI, user behavior, and monetization rates vary dramatically by geography.

---

## H

### Header Bidding

**A technique where publishers offer their ad inventory to multiple ad exchanges simultaneously before calling their ad server.** This creates more competition for each impression, typically increasing the publisher's revenue by 20-50% compared to the traditional "waterfall" method. Prebid.js is the dominant open-source header bidding library. See [Real-Time Bidding](/adtech/rtb) for details.

---

## I

### IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers)

**Apple's advertising identifier for iOS devices.** It is a unique, resettable ID that allows ad platforms to track which ad led to an install. Since iOS 14.5, users must explicitly opt in via the ATT prompt before apps can access the IDFA. Only about 20-25% of users opt in.

### Impression

**A single instance of your ad being shown to a user on their screen.** One person seeing your ad 3 times counts as 3 impressions but only 1 reach. Note that an impression does not mean the user actually looked at or noticed your ad -- just that it was displayed on their screen.

### Incrementality

**Measuring whether your ads actually caused conversions that would not have happened organically.** Some users would have installed your app even without seeing an ad. The most common method is a holdout test: you withhold ads from a random group and compare their conversion rate to the group that saw ads. The difference is your true incremental lift. See [Attribution Deep Dive](/adtech/attribution-deep-dive).

### Install (as a metric)

**When someone downloads and opens your app for the first time after clicking or viewing an ad.** This is what you pay for with app install campaigns. Important: a "download" alone is usually not counted as an install -- the user must actually open the app, which triggers the `first_open` event.

### Interest Targeting

**Targeting ads to users based on their interests as determined by the ad platform's algorithms.** For example, targeting users interested in "fitness," "yoga," or "healthy eating." The platform infers interests from user behavior -- what they search for, what apps they use, what content they engage with, and what pages they follow.

---

## J

### JSON Postback

**A server-to-server callback that sends conversion data in JSON format from an MMP to an ad network.** When a user installs your app, the MMP fires a JSON postback to every ad network that showed the user an ad, telling each one whether it was credited with the install. The credited network gets the "attributed" flag; others get a "rejected" flag.

---

## K

### KPI (Key Performance Indicator)

**The most important metric you use to measure success for a specific campaign or goal.** For app install campaigns, your primary KPI might be CPI. For revenue campaigns, it might be ROAS. Having a clear KPI keeps you focused on what matters and prevents you from getting distracted by vanity metrics like impressions.

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: Before launching any campaign, write down your primary KPI and the target number. For example: "Primary KPI: CPI. Target: under $3.00." This simple exercise prevents scope creep and helps you make clear go/no-go decisions when reviewing performance.
</Tip>

### Keyword

**A word or phrase you bid on in search advertising (Google Ads, Apple Search Ads).** When someone searches for that keyword or a related term, your ad may appear in the search results. Keywords can be branded (your app name) or non-branded (generic terms like "fitness tracker"). Choosing the right keywords and match types is critical for search ad performance.

---

## L

### Landing Page

**The page someone sees after clicking your ad.** For app ads, the landing page is usually your App Store or Play Store listing. For web campaigns, it is a dedicated web page designed to convert visitors. A well-optimized landing page is critical -- even the best ad will fail if the landing page does not convince people to take the next step.

### Lifetime Budget

**The total amount you want to spend over the entire duration of a campaign, as opposed to a daily budget.** You set a total of $500 and a date range of two weeks, and the platform automatically paces your spending across those 14 days. Lifetime budgets give the platform more flexibility to spend more on high-performing days.

### Lifetime Value (LTV)

**The total revenue a single user generates over their entire time using your app.** LTV is the holy grail metric for app advertisers. If your LTV is greater than your CPI, you are making money on each user.

LTV is usually measured at specific time windows: Day 7 LTV, Day 30 LTV, Day 90 LTV, Day 365 LTV. See [Analytics Setup](/playbook/analytics-setup) for how to calculate it.

### Lookalike Audience

**An audience the ad platform creates by analyzing your existing best users and finding new people who share similar characteristics.** You give Meta your best 1,000 customers (a "seed audience"), and Meta finds millions more who "look like" them. Lookalike audiences are one of the most powerful targeting tools and usually outperform interest-based targeting once you have enough seed data.

---

## M

### MMP (Mobile Measurement Partner)

**A third-party tool that independently tracks which ads drive installs and in-app events across all ad platforms.** It acts as a neutral referee -- when a user installs your app after seeing ads on both Meta and TikTok, the MMP determines which platform actually drove the install. Examples: Airbridge, AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, Singular. See [Attribution Deep Dive](/adtech/attribution-deep-dive) for the complete MMP guide.

### MMM (Media Mix Modeling)

**A statistical technique that uses aggregate historical data (weekly spend and conversions) to determine which marketing channels are most effective.** Unlike MTA (multi-touch attribution), MMM does not require user-level tracking, making it privacy-safe. It can also measure offline channels like TV and radio. Google's Meridian and Meta's Robyn are popular open-source MMM tools.

### MOFU (Middle of Funnel)

**The middle stage of the marketing funnel, where users have shown interest but have not yet converted.** For app advertising, MOFU users might include people who visited your App Store listing but did not install, or users who installed but have not signed up or made a purchase. MOFU strategies focus on nudging interested users toward conversion.

---

## N

### Negative Keyword

**A keyword you add to your search campaigns to prevent your ad from showing for irrelevant searches.** If you sell a premium paid fitness app, you might add "free" as a negative keyword so your ad does not appear when someone searches "free fitness app." Negative keywords are essential for keeping search campaigns efficient and avoiding wasted spend.

---

## O

### Objective

**The goal you select when creating a campaign on any ad platform.** Common objectives include App Installs, Conversions, Traffic, Brand Awareness, Reach, Video Views, and Lead Generation. The objective tells the platform's algorithm what kind of users to find and optimize for. Choosing the right objective is crucial -- if you want purchases, optimize for purchases, not installs.

### OACV (Optimized for App Conversion Value)

**A Google Ads feature that uses Firebase conversion value data to optimize for higher-value installs.** Instead of finding any user who might install, it prioritizes users who are more likely to make purchases or complete valuable in-app actions. This requires good conversion tracking with value data flowing from Firebase to Google Ads.

### Optimization

**The ongoing process of improving campaign performance based on data.** This happens at two levels: the platform's algorithm automatically optimizes ad delivery in real-time (finding better audiences, adjusting bids), and you manually optimize by adjusting budgets, refreshing creatives, and refining targeting based on performance data.

### Optimization Event

**The specific user action you tell the ad platform to optimize for.** If you choose "App Installs," the platform finds people most likely to install. If you choose "Purchase," it finds people most likely to buy. Choosing a higher-value optimization event usually gets you better users, but requires at least 50 conversions per week for the algorithm to learn effectively.

---

## P

### Pacing

**How the ad platform distributes your budget over time within a day or across a campaign's lifetime.** "Standard" pacing spreads your budget evenly throughout the day. "Accelerated" pacing spends your budget as fast as possible, which can exhaust it before the day ends. Standard pacing is recommended in almost all cases.

### Performance Max (PMax)

**A Google Ads campaign type that automatically runs your ads across all Google inventory -- Search, Display, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, and Discover.** You provide creative assets and conversion goals, and Google's machine learning handles placement, bidding, and audience targeting. It is Google's most automated campaign type.

### Phrase Match

**A keyword match type in Google Ads where your ad shows when someone searches for your keyword phrase, even with additional words before or after it.** "fitness app" in phrase match triggers for "best fitness app for beginners" or "fitness app reviews." It offers a middle ground between exact match (strictest) and broad match (loosest).

### Pixel

**A small piece of tracking code installed on a website that sends user behavior data back to an ad platform.** For apps, the equivalent of a pixel is the SDK. When someone visits your website, the pixel tells the ad platform what pages they viewed and whether they converted.

### Placement

**The specific location where your ad appears.** Instagram Feed, Facebook Stories, TikTok For You page, Google Search results, YouTube pre-roll, App Store search results -- each is a different placement. Different placements have different specs, costs, and performance characteristics.

### Postback

**A server-to-server notification sent from an MMP or attribution provider to an ad network when a conversion event occurs.** Postbacks are the mechanism by which ad networks learn that their ads drove results. They are more reliable than client-side tracking because they happen between servers and are not affected by app crashes or poor network connections.

### PPC (Pay Per Click)

**A pricing model where you pay each time someone clicks your ad.** Google Search Ads and Apple Search Ads primarily use PPC pricing. The term is also used broadly to refer to search advertising in general. In PPC, you bid on keywords and only pay when someone actually clicks -- you do not pay just for impressions.

### Privacy Sandbox

**Google's initiative to replace third-party cookies and cross-app tracking with privacy-preserving alternatives.** On Android, it includes the Topics API (interest-based targeting) and the Attribution Reporting API (conversion measurement without exposing user data). See [Fraud & Privacy](/adtech/fraud-and-privacy) for the complete privacy landscape.

### Programmatic

**The automated buying and selling of ad space using software and real-time auctions, as opposed to manual negotiation.** Most digital advertising today is programmatic. When you buy ads on Google, Meta, or TikTok, you are participating in programmatic advertising -- the platform handles the auction and placement automatically. See [Programmatic Advertising](/adtech/programmatic).

---

## Q

### Quality Score

**A Google Ads metric rated 1-10 that estimates the quality and relevance of your keywords, ads, and landing pages.** Higher Quality Scores lead to lower costs per click and better ad positions. It is based on three factors: expected click-through rate, ad relevance, and landing page experience.

Improving Quality Score is one of the most effective ways to reduce your Google Ads costs.

---

## R

### Reach

**The number of unique people who saw your ad at least once.** Different from impressions: if 1,000 people each saw your ad twice, your reach is 1,000 but your impressions are 2,000. Reach tells you how many different people you are reaching, while impressions tell you how many total times the ad was shown.

### Remarketing

See **Retargeting** below. Google uses the term "remarketing" while Meta and most other platforms use "retargeting." They mean exactly the same thing.

### Retargeting

**Showing ads to people who already interacted with your brand -- they visited your website, opened your app, added something to their cart but did not buy.** Retargeting campaigns usually have much higher conversion rates than prospecting campaigns because these users already know who you are. See [Retargeting](/playbook/retargeting) for the complete guide.

### ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)

**How much revenue you earn for each dollar you spend on ads.** Formula: Revenue / Ad Spend. A ROAS of 3x means you make $3 in revenue for every $1 you spend. ROAS greater than 1.0 means your ads are profitable.

Always specify the time window: Day 7 ROAS, Day 30 ROAS, Day 90 ROAS. Most campaigns are not profitable at Day 7 -- the question is when they become profitable.

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: For subscription apps, a Day 7 ROAS of 0.3x to 0.5x is often healthy because LTV accumulates over months as users renew their subscriptions. Do not panic if your early ROAS looks low -- check your cohort analysis to see if users are generating revenue over time. If Day 30 ROAS is trending toward 1.0x, you are likely on track.
</Tip>

### RSA (Responsive Search Ad)

**A Google Ads search format where you provide multiple headlines (up to 15) and descriptions (up to 4), and Google automatically tests combinations.** Google's machine learning finds the best-performing headline + description combos for each search query. RSAs are now the default search ad type in Google Ads.

### RTB (Real-Time Bidding)

**The process of buying and selling ad impressions in automated auctions that happen in milliseconds.** Every time a user opens an app or loads a webpage, an auction occurs instantly among multiple advertisers. The entire process -- from auction to ad display -- typically takes less than 100 milliseconds. See [Real-Time Bidding](/adtech/rtb) for the deep dive.

---

## S

### S2S (Server-to-Server)

**A method of sending data directly between servers, bypassing the user's device entirely.** In advertising, S2S is used for conversion tracking (postbacks from MMPs to ad networks) and event forwarding (sending events from your server to ad platform APIs like Meta CAPI). S2S tracking is more reliable than client-side tracking because it is not affected by ad blockers, app crashes, or network issues.

### Search Match

**An Apple Search Ads feature that automatically matches your ad to relevant search terms based on your app metadata.** Apple's algorithm analyzes your app title, description, keywords, and category to determine which searches your ad should appear for. It is similar to Google's broad match but specific to the App Store. Useful for discovering new keywords but requires monitoring for irrelevant matches.

### Search Term

**The actual words a user types into a search engine.** This is different from a keyword -- you bid on keywords, but users type search terms. Your keyword "fitness app" might match the search term "best fitness tracking app for runners." Understanding which search terms trigger your ads helps you refine your keyword strategy.

### SKAdNetwork (SKAN)

**Apple's privacy-friendly attribution framework for iOS.** It provides conversion data to ad networks without revealing individual user identity. SKAN data is delayed (24-72 hours), aggregated, and limited in granularity. It is the primary attribution method for iOS users who deny ATT tracking (75-80% of users).

SKAN 4.0 (now called AdAttributionKit) introduced multiple postbacks, crowd anonymity tiers, and more flexible conversion value schemes. See [Attribution Deep Dive](/adtech/attribution-deep-dive) for the complete SKAN guide.

### Smart Bidding

**Google's suite of automated bidding strategies that use machine learning to optimize for conversions in real-time.** Options include Target CPA, Target ROAS, Maximize Conversions, and Maximize Conversion Value. Smart Bidding considers dozens of real-time signals -- device, location, time of day, audience, search query -- to set the optimal bid for each auction.

### Spark Ads

**A TikTok ad format that lets you boost existing organic TikTok posts (yours or a creator's) as paid ads.** Spark Ads look and feel like native TikTok content, which is why they typically get higher engagement than standard in-feed ads. All engagement (likes, comments, shares, follows) flows to the original organic post, providing lasting value beyond the paid campaign.

### SSP (Supply-Side Platform)

**Software that publishers use to manage and sell their ad inventory programmatically.** The SSP is the publisher's counterpart to the advertiser's DSP. SSPs connect to ad exchanges to offer ad impressions to the highest bidder. Examples: Google Ad Manager, Magnite, PubMatic. See [Programmatic Advertising](/adtech/programmatic).

---

## T

### Targeting

**Defining who should see your ads based on characteristics like demographics, interests, behaviors, keywords, or custom audiences.** Good targeting ensures your ads reach people most likely to become valuable users. Over-targeting limits reach and raises costs; under-targeting wastes budget on irrelevant users. See [Targeting Technology](/adtech/targeting-deep-dive).

### Third-Party Cookie

**A cookie placed on a user's browser by a domain other than the one they are visiting, used for cross-site tracking and ad targeting.** Third-party cookies are being phased out by all major browsers. Safari and Firefox already block them by default, and Chrome is transitioning to Privacy Sandbox alternatives. This is one of the biggest shifts in digital advertising. See [Fraud & Privacy](/adtech/fraud-and-privacy).

### TOFU (Top of Funnel)

**The top stage of the marketing funnel, focused on awareness and discovery.** For app advertising, TOFU means reaching new people who have never heard of your app. TOFU campaigns prioritize reach, impressions, and video views over direct installs or purchases. The goal is to build brand recognition for later conversion campaigns.

### Tracking

**The process of recording user actions -- ad impressions, clicks, installs, sign-ups, purchases -- so you can measure ad performance.** Tracking requires SDKs in your app, pixels on your website, or server-side integrations. Without proper tracking, you cannot calculate CPI, ROAS, or LTV, which means you are spending money blind.

## U

### UAC (Universal App Campaign)

**Google's automated app campaign type (now officially called "App campaigns" but still widely referred to as UAC).** You provide text, images, and videos, and Google distributes your ads across Search, Play Store, YouTube, Display, and Discover. Google's machine learning handles targeting, bidding, and creative combinations.

### UGC (User Generated Content)

**Content created by real people rather than brands or professional studios.** In advertising, UGC-style ads look like authentic personal videos -- someone talking to their phone camera about why they love an app. UGC-style ads often outperform polished branded content, especially on TikTok and Instagram Reels, because they feel native and trustworthy.

### UTM (Urchin Tracking Module)

**Tags added to the end of a URL to track where traffic comes from.** A UTM-tagged URL looks like: `yoursite.com?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=summer_sale`.

There are five UTM parameters: source, medium, campaign, term, and content. Analytics tools like GA4 automatically read these tags and attribute traffic accordingly. See [Analytics Setup](/playbook/analytics-setup) for naming conventions.

## V

### VTA (View-Through Attribution)

**An attribution model that gives credit to an ad that was viewed (but not clicked) before a conversion.** If a user sees your video ad, does not click, but installs your app two days later, VTA credits the video ad. Most platforms offer a 1-day view-through attribution window by default. VTA typically inflates reported conversions compared to click-only attribution.

### View-Through

**A conversion attributed to a user who saw your ad but did not click it, and later converted on their own.** For example, someone sees your Instagram ad while scrolling, does not click, but later searches for your app and installs it. View-through attribution is controversial because it is hard to prove the ad view actually influenced the decision.

## W

### Walled Garden

**A closed platform ecosystem where the company controls access to user data and does not share it with outsiders.** Meta, Google, Apple, Amazon, and TikTok are all walled gardens -- each has massive amounts of user data, but they only let advertisers see limited, aggregated performance metrics.

This is one of the key reasons MMPs exist: they provide a way to measure across walled gardens that would otherwise be impossible to compare directly. See [The Ad Tech Ecosystem](/adtech/ecosystem-players) for a deeper discussion.
