## You built it. Now ship it to the world.

Hey there, fellow builder. Welcome.

You spent weeks — or maybe one magical weekend — vibe-coding your app. You poured your heart into every screen, every animation, every little detail. It works. It's beautiful. You're proud of it.

But here's the thing: **nobody knows it exists yet.**

Right now, your app is sitting in the App Store alongside **~2.1 million other apps**. On Google Play, it's competing with **~2.2 million apps**. That's over 4 million apps total, all fighting for attention. Without a plan to get discovered, even the most brilliant app can stay invisible forever.

**That's where ads come in.** And that's exactly what this guide is about.

We're going to take you from "I don't even know what a CPM is" to confidently running your first ad campaign — step by step, no jargon left unexplained, no assumptions about what you already know.

<Tip>
**Pro Tip from the Ship Your Ads team:** You don't need to read this entire guide in one sitting. Bookmark it, come back when you need it. But if you're eager to launch your first campaign today, you can realistically do it in about 2-3 hours by following along.

## Who is this for?

This guide was built with a very specific person in mind. Let's see if that's you.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Vibe coders who just shipped their first app">
    You can build anything with code. You've figured out SwiftUI, or React Native, or Flutter. You pushed through bugs at 2am. You shipped. But now you're staring at your App Store Connect dashboard showing 3 downloads (two of which are your mom and your best friend), and you're thinking: "Now what?"

    Marketing feels like a completely different language — and honestly, it kind of is. But here's the good news: **you already have the hardest skill** (building things). Learning to run ads is way easier than learning to code. We'll translate the marketing world into developer-speak for you.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Indie hackers who want their first 1,000 users">
    You've heard the advice: "Just get your first 1,000 true fans." But nobody tells you *how*. Posting on Reddit gets you 12 upvotes. Tweeting about your app gets 3 likes (all from bots). Product Hunt gave you a spike for one day, then silence.

    You don't need a marketing team. You don't need to hire an agency. You need a clear playbook, a small budget (seriously, $10-20/day is enough to start), and the willingness to experiment. That's exactly what we'll give you.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Developers who are curious about how ads work">
    Ever wondered what happens when you tap "Skip Ad"? Ever been freaked out by how Instagram shows you an ad for something you *just* talked about? Ever wanted to understand the massive technical infrastructure behind digital advertising?

    We'll show you the other side. The auction systems, the real-time bidding, the machine learning models — all explained in a way that makes sense to someone who thinks in code. It's genuinely fascinating once you understand it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Small teams (1-5 people) without a marketing person">
    Maybe you're a small startup. Maybe it's just you and a designer. Or you and a friend. Either way, there's no "marketing person" on the team, and hiring one isn't in the budget right now.

    Good news: modern ad platforms are designed to be self-serve. They *want* you to succeed without an agency. This guide will make you the marketing person on your team — at least enough to get started and get real results.

## How to use this guide

Here's the path we recommend. Think of it like a tutorial in a video game — each step builds on the last.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Understand why ads matter (10 minutes)">
    Read [Why You Need Ads](/why-ads). Even if you're already convinced, this page will give you the data and mental framework to think about user acquisition strategically. You'll understand the economics of getting users and why organic-only strategies often fail.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Learn how ads work under the hood (15 minutes)">
    Read [How Ads Actually Work](/how-ads-work). This is the "aha!" moment. Once you understand the auction system, everything else — every platform, every feature, every optimization trick — will make intuitive sense. It's like learning how HTTP works before building a web app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build your knowledge with core concepts (30 minutes)">
    Go through the [Core Concepts](/concepts/ad-ecosystem) section. Each page is a focused 5-minute read: the ad ecosystem, campaign structures, targeting, bidding, and creatives. By the end, you'll speak "ads" fluently.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch your first campaign (1-2 hours)">
    Follow the [Your First Campaign](/first-campaign/before-you-start) guide step by step. We'll walk you through choosing a platform, setting up tracking (so you know what's working), creating your campaign, and launching it. You'll go from zero to a live ad campaign.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Optimize and scale">
    Once your first campaign is running, dive into the [Platform Guides](/platforms/meta/overview) for platform-specific optimization tips, and check out the [Playbook](/playbook/budget-planning) section for advanced strategies like budget planning, creative testing, and retargeting.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **This guide is opinionated — on purpose.** We won't give you 10 options and let you figure it out. We'll tell you exactly what to do, based on what works best for indie developers and small teams. There are many valid approaches to advertising, but when you're starting out, having one clear path is worth more than having all the options.

  If you want a comprehensive advertising textbook, this isn't it. If you want to **ship ads today**, keep reading.
</Note>

Here's what we believe, and what this entire guide is built on:
