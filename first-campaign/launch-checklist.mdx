## The Launch Checklist

Print this. Screenshot this. Tape it to your monitor.

### Before launch

- [ ] **App is live** on the App Store / Play Store
- [ ] **App Store listing** looks professional (icon, screenshots, description)
- [ ] **Tracking SDK** is installed and verified working
- [ ] **Payment method** is added to the ad platform
- [ ] **Creatives** are ready (3+ variations)
- [ ] **Budget** is set (start with $10-20/day)
- [ ] **Targeting** is configured (broad, not too narrow)
- [ ] **Campaign objective** is "App Installs"
- [ ] **Ad preview** looks good on mobile

### After launch

- [ ] Campaign status shows **"Active"** (not "In Review" or "Rejected")
- [ ] First **impressions** are showing up (check after 2-4 hours)
- [ ] **Don't touch anything** for 3-5 days
- [ ] Check results **once per day** (not every hour)
- [ ] After 5-7 days, review and decide: scale, optimize, or try new creative

### If something goes wrong

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Ad rejected | Read the rejection reason. Usually it's a policy issue — fix the creative and resubmit |
| No impressions after 24h | Check if your audience isn't too small or budget too low |
| High CPI ($5+) | Your creative probably isn't resonating. Try new creatives |
| Lots of clicks but no installs | Your App Store listing needs work |
| Campaign stuck in review | Wait 48h, then contact platform support |

## Congratulations!

If you made it here, you've done something most developers never do: **you actually shipped your ads.**

<Note>
  Your first campaign probably won't be perfect. That's expected and totally fine.
  The fact that you launched at all puts you ahead of 90% of indie developers.
