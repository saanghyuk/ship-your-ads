    ## Meta: Your first campaign in 10 steps

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Go to Meta Ads Manager">
        Open [adsmanager.facebook.com](https://adsmanager.facebook.com) and click **+ Create**.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Choose your objective: App Promotion">
        Select **"App promotion"** → **"App installs"**.
        This tells Meta to find people most likely to install your app.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Name your campaign">
        Use a clear naming convention:
        ```
        [App Name] - [Objective] - [Date]
        Example: MyApp - Installs - 2024-01
        ```
        Turn on **Advantage Campaign Budget** and set $15/day.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Select your app">
        Choose your app from the dropdown. If it's not there, register it in the Facebook Developer portal first.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Set up your Ad Set — Audience">
        - **Location:** Your target country (start with one)
        - **Age:** 18-45 (start broad)
        - **Interests:** Add 2-3 relevant interests
        - **Placements:** Choose **Advantage+ placements** (let Meta decide)

        <Tip>
          Your audience size should show **1M-10M people**. If it's under 500K, you're too narrow.
        </Tip>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Set up your Ad — Creative">
        - Upload your **image or video**
        - Write your **primary text** (keep it under 125 characters)
        - Write a **headline** (keep it punchy, under 40 characters)
        - Select CTA: **"Install Now"**
      </Step>

      <Step title="Add more ad variations">
        Duplicate your ad and change ONE thing each time:
        - Ad 2: Different image/video
        - Ad 3: Different primary text
        - Ad 4: Different headline

        Meta will automatically show the best-performing one more.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Review everything">
        Double-check:
        - ✅ Correct app selected
        - ✅ Budget is what you intended
        - ✅ Audience looks right
        - ✅ Creatives look good in preview
        - ✅ Payment method is set
      </Step>

      <Step title="Hit Publish">
        Click **"Publish"**. Your campaign will go into review (usually 15 min - 24 hours).
      </Step>

      <Step title="Wait and don't touch anything">
        Seriously. **Do not change anything for 3-5 days.**
        Check your results once a day, but don't tweak.
        The algorithm needs time to learn.

  <Tab title="Google Ads">
    ## Google: Your first App campaign

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Go to Google Ads">
        Open [ads.google.com](https://ads.google.com) and click **+ New Campaign**.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Choose objective: App promotion">
        Select **"App promotion"** → **"App installs"**.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Select your app">
        Search for your app by name or paste the store URL.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Name and set budget">
        Name your campaign clearly. Set a daily budget of **$15-20/day**.
        Choose **"Target cost per install"** and set it to your target CPI (start with $2-3).
      </Step>

      <Step title="Set targeting">
        - **Locations:** Your target countries
        - **Languages:** Languages your app supports
        - Google App campaigns handle most targeting automatically.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Add your ad assets">
        Google App campaigns are unique — you provide **building blocks** and Google assembles them:

        - **2-5 headlines** (max 30 characters each)
        - **2-5 descriptions** (max 90 characters each)
        - **Up to 20 images** (landscape, portrait, square)
        - **Up to 20 videos** (or Google uses your Play Store assets)
      </Step>

      <Step title="Review and launch">
        Check everything and click **"Create Campaign"**.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Wait for the learning phase">
        Google App campaigns need **2-3 weeks** and **~100 conversions** to fully optimize.
        Be patient.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Warning>
      Google App campaigns give you **less control** than Meta. You can't choose exact placements or audiences.
      Google's AI handles it. This can feel frustrating, but it often works well.
