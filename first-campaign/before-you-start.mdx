## Welcome, future advertiser!

You built an app. That is genuinely hard, and you should be proud. Now you want people to actually find it and use it. That is where advertising comes in.

This page is your **complete pre-flight checklist**. We will walk through every single thing you need to have ready before you spend your first dollar on ads. Skipping any of these steps is like launching a rocket without checking the fuel gauge. Let's not do that.

<Note>
  **Take your time here.** Spending 1-2 hours on this checklist now will save you hundreds of dollars later. We promise.

## Step-by-step checklist

<Steps>
  <Step title="Make sure your app is live on the App Store or Play Store">
    This might sound obvious, but you cannot advertise an app that people cannot download. Your app must be:

    - **Published** and visible in the store (not "Developer Access Only" or "TestFlight Only")
    - **Downloadable** by anyone in your target countries
    - **Functional** — it should not crash on launch or have major bugs

    How to check:
    1. Open the App Store or Google Play Store on your phone
    2. Search for your app name
    3. Tap "Get" or "Install"
    4. Open the app and make sure it works

    <Warning>
      Some ad platforms (like Meta) take **24-48 hours** to verify your app after you register it in their system. Do NOT wait until the day you want to launch ads. Register your app on the ad platform at least 2-3 days in advance.
    </Warning>

    <Tip>
      **Pro Tip:** If your app was just approved today, wait at least 24 hours before trying to register it on ad platforms. The store listing needs time to propagate across all servers worldwide.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Optimize your App Store listing (this is CRITICAL)">
    Here is something many beginners miss: **your ad gets people TO the App Store page, but your listing convinces them to actually INSTALL**. If your store listing is bad, even the best ad in the world will not work.

    Think of it like this: your ad is the movie trailer, and your store listing is the ticket counter. If the ticket counter looks sketchy, nobody is buying.

    ### Your app icon

    - Should be **simple, recognizable, and unique**
    - Avoid text in the icon (it is too small to read at icon size)
    - Use bold colors that stand out against both light and dark backgrounds
    - Look at the top apps in your category for inspiration (do NOT copy them)

    ### Your screenshots (aim for 5-8)

    This is where most beginners lose potential users. Great screenshots:

    - **Tell a story** — each screenshot should show a different benefit or feature
    - **Use the first 2 screenshots wisely** — these are the only ones most people see before scrolling
    - **Add text captions** on top of the screenshots explaining what the user is seeing
    - **Show the app in action**, not just static screens
    - **Use real content**, not placeholder text like "Lorem ipsum"

    Recommended sizes:
    - iPhone: 1290 x 2796 pixels (iPhone 15 Pro Max)
    - iPad: 2048 x 2732 pixels
    - Android: 1080 x 1920 pixels (minimum)

    <Tip>
      **Pro Tip:** Your first two screenshots should answer this question: "Why should I install this app?" If they do not, redesign them. Tools like Canva, Figma, or AppMockUp make this easy even if you are not a designer.
    </Tip>

    ### Your app description

    - **First 1-3 lines matter most** — this is what shows before "Read More"
    - Lead with your biggest benefit, not a feature list
    - Use short paragraphs and bullet points
    - Include relevant keywords naturally (this helps App Store search)

    Good example:
    > "Track your daily habits in under 10 seconds. Join 50,000+ people building better routines."

    Bad example:
    > "HabitApp is a habit tracking application developed by XYZ Inc. that allows users to track habits."

    ### Ratings and reviews

    - Aim for at least **5-10 ratings** before running ads
    - Ask friends, family, or beta testers to leave honest reviews
    - A 4.0+ star rating significantly improves conversion rates

    <Tip>
      **Pro Tip from App Store Optimization experts:** Apps with fewer than 5 ratings see **30-50% lower conversion rates** from ads. Even a few honest reviews make a big difference. Never buy fake reviews though — both Apple and Google will penalize you.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up your payment method">
    Every ad platform needs a credit card or debit card to charge for your ads. Here is how to set this up safely:

    ### What you need
    - A credit card, debit card, or virtual card
    - The card must allow international transactions (most ad platforms charge from the US or Ireland)

    ### Safety tips for beginners

    <Warning>
      **Do NOT use your primary debit card with your life savings.** Seriously. Use a card with a low limit or a dedicated virtual card. Mistakes happen, and you do not want a $500 surprise on your rent money card.
    </Warning>

    Recommended approach:
    1. **Best option:** Create a virtual card through your bank or a service like Revolut, Wise, or Privacy.com
    2. **Set a spending limit** on the virtual card (e.g., $200-500 for your first month)
    3. **Second best:** Use a credit card with a low limit dedicated to advertising
    4. **Also good:** Use PayPal where available (Meta and Google both support it)

    ### Setting budget caps on ad platforms

    Most platforms let you set **account-level spending limits** in addition to campaign budgets. Here is where to find them:

    - **Meta:** Settings > Payment Settings > Account Spending Limit
    - **Google:** Tools > Billing > Budget & Strategy
    - **TikTok:** Payment > Auto-payment settings
    - **Apple Search Ads:** Your campaign budget acts as the limit

    <Tip>
      **Pro Tip:** Set an account spending limit of $200-300 for your first month. This way, even if you accidentally create a high-budget campaign, the platform will pause everything once you hit the cap. You can always raise it later.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Prepare your creative assets">
    "Creatives" is ad-industry speak for the images, videos, and text that make up your actual ads. Here is exactly what you need for each platform:

    ### For Meta (Facebook / Instagram)

    **Images (prepare at least 3 variations):**
    | Format | Size | Where it shows |
    |--------|------|----------------|
    | Square | 1080 x 1080 px | Facebook Feed, Instagram Feed |
    | Vertical | 1080 x 1350 px | Instagram Feed (takes more space) |
    | Stories/Reels | 1080 x 1920 px | Instagram Stories, Facebook Stories, Reels |

    **Video (if you have one):**
    - 15-30 seconds is the sweet spot
    - Vertical (9:16) for Stories/Reels, Square (1:1) for Feeds
    - Keep file size under 4GB
    - Add captions (85% of people watch without sound)

    **Text you will need:**
    - Primary text: 1-2 sentences (under 125 characters is ideal)
    - Headline: Short and punchy (under 40 characters)
    - Description: Optional secondary text

    ### For Google Ads

    **Images:**
    | Format | Size |
    |--------|------|
    | Landscape | 1200 x 628 px |
    | Square | 1200 x 1200 px |
    | Portrait | 1200 x 1500 px |

    **Text:**
    - 2-5 headlines (max 30 characters each)
    - 2-5 descriptions (max 90 characters each)

    ### For TikTok Ads

    **Video (required — TikTok is video-first):**
    - Vertical: 1080 x 1920 px
    - 15-60 seconds (15-30 is best)
    - Must feel native to TikTok — overly polished ads perform worse
    - Add trending sounds or music

    ### For Apple Search Ads

    **Good news:** Apple Search Ads automatically uses your App Store screenshots and metadata. No extra creative needed for Basic campaigns.

    <Tip>
      **Pro Tip:** You do NOT need expensive design tools or a professional designer for your first ads. A simple screen recording of your app with text overlays works surprisingly well. Tools like Canva (free), CapCut (free), or even your phone's screen recorder are enough to get started.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set realistic expectations (the most important step)">
    Let's talk real numbers so you know what to expect. These are rough industry averages for mobile app install campaigns:

    ### What things typically cost

    | Metric | Range | What it means |
    |--------|-------|---------------|
    | **CPI (Cost Per Install)** | $1-5 for most apps | How much you pay for each person who installs your app |
    | **CTR (Click-Through Rate)** | 0.5% - 2% | Out of 100 people who see your ad, 1-2 click on it |
    | **CVR (Conversion Rate)** | 20% - 40% | Out of people who click, this many actually install |
    | **CPM (Cost Per 1,000 Impressions)** | $5-15 | How much it costs for 1,000 people to see your ad |

    ### What this means for your budget

    With a $15/day budget:
    - You will get roughly **1,000-3,000 impressions** per day
    - Out of those, **5-30 people** will click your ad
    - Out of those, **2-10 people** will install your app
    - After 7 days, you will have spent **$105** and gotten **15-70 installs**

    These numbers vary WILDLY based on your app, your creatives, your targeting, and your industry. But this gives you a baseline.

    <Warning>
      **Your first campaign will almost certainly NOT be your best.** The first campaign is about learning. If you get any installs at all, that is a win. You will improve dramatically over your first few campaigns.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adopt the right mindset">
    This is the step that separates people who succeed with ads from people who give up after a week.

    <Note>
      Think of your first **$100-200 in ad spend as tuition**. You are paying to learn. Even if every single ad flopped (unlikely), you would walk away understanding more about your users than months of guessing would teach you.
    </Note>

    ### What success looks like for a first campaign

    - You learned how the ad platform works
    - You saw real data about what interests your potential users
    - You got some installs (even 10 installs is valuable data)
    - You have ideas for what to try next
    - You overcame the fear of spending money on ads

    ### What is NOT a failure

    - Getting "only" 20 installs with $100 spent
    - Having a high CPI on your first try
    - Needing to pause and try again with different creatives
    - Feeling confused by the dashboard (everyone does at first)

    ### What IS a failure

    - Never launching at all because you were waiting for "perfect"
    - Spending money without tracking (so you learned nothing)
    - Changing everything every 12 hours and never letting the algorithm learn

    <Tip>
      **Pro Tip from experienced advertisers:** The most common beginner mistake is changing things too fast. The ad platform algorithms need 3-5 days to "learn" who your best audience is. Every time you make a change, the learning resets. Set it up, launch it, and leave it alone for at least 5 days.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

## Common beginner mistakes (and how to avoid them)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Mistake #1: Targeting too narrowly">
    **The mistake:** Selecting a very specific audience like "Women, age 25-30, who like yoga, live in Brooklyn, and own a dog."

    **Why it is bad:** The ad algorithm is smarter than you think. When you target too narrowly, you give it no room to find the best audience. You also make your ads more expensive because there are fewer people to show them to.

    **The fix:** Start broad. Target a wide age range (18-45), your whole country (or a large region), and 2-3 broad interests at most. Let the algorithm do its job.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mistake #2: Only making one ad">
    **The mistake:** Creating a single ad with one image and one piece of text.

    **Why it is bad:** You have no idea what will resonate with people. What you think is the best angle for your app is often NOT what users care about.

    **The fix:** Create at least 3 variations. Same app, different angles. Different images, different headlines, different value propositions. The platform will automatically show the best one more.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mistake #3: Setting a budget that is too low">
    **The mistake:** Setting a $2/day budget because "I want to be careful."

    **Why it is bad:** Ad platforms need a minimum amount of data to optimize. With $2/day, you might get 0-1 installs per day, which is not enough data for the algorithm to learn anything.

    **The fix:** Budget at least $10-20/day. If that feels scary, set a lower account-level spending limit and run for fewer days instead.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mistake #4: Panicking after 24 hours">
    **The mistake:** Checking your dashboard every hour and freaking out when you see high costs or low installs on day 1.

    **Why it is bad:** The first 1-3 days are the "learning phase." Costs are ALWAYS higher at the start. This is normal. Panicking and changing things resets the learning.

    **The fix:** Launch your campaign. Check it once per day. Do NOT make changes for at least 3-5 days. We know this is hard. Do it anyway.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mistake #5: Ignoring the App Store listing">
    **The mistake:** Running great ads but having a terrible App Store page with blurry screenshots and a confusing description.

    **Why it is bad:** People click your ad, land on your App Store page, see it looks unprofessional, and leave. You pay for the click but get no install.

    **The fix:** Go back to Step 2 above and make your listing great. Your conversion rate (clicks to installs) depends heavily on this.
  </Accordion>

## Quick reference: minimum budgets by platform

| Platform | Technical Minimum | Our Recommendation for Beginners |
|----------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Meta (Facebook/Instagram)** | $5/day | $10-20/day |
| **Google Ads** | No official minimum | $10-50/day |
| **TikTok Ads** | $20/day (ad group), $500/campaign lifetime | $20-50/day |
| **Apple Search Ads** | No minimum (pay per tap) | $10-30/day |

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip:** For your very first campaign, **$15/day for 7 days ($105 total)** is a great starting point on Meta or Google. It is enough data for the algorithm to learn, and affordable enough that it will not break the bank.
