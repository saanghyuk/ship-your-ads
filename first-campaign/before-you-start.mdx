## Pre-flight checklist

Before launching your first ad, run through this checklist. Missing any of these will waste your money.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Your app is live on the App Store / Play Store">
    You can't advertise an app that isn't published yet. Make sure it's approved and downloadable.

    <Warning>
      Some platforms (like Meta) take 24-48 hours to verify your app after you register it.
      Don't wait until the last minute.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Your app store listing is solid">
    Your ad gets people TO the App Store. Your listing convinces them to INSTALL.

    Must-haves:
    - Clear app icon
    - Compelling screenshots (5 is ideal)
    - Short, benefit-focused description
    - At least a few ratings (ask friends/family if needed)
  </Step>

  <Step title="You have a credit card ready">
    Every ad platform needs a payment method. A regular credit or debit card works.

    <Tip>
      Use a card with a **low limit** or a **virtual card** for your first campaigns.
      This prevents accidental overspending while you're learning.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="You have basic creatives ready">
    At minimum:
    - **3 images** (1080×1080) showing your app
    - OR **1 short video** (15-30 seconds) of your app in action
    - **2-3 text variations** for the ad copy

    See our [Creatives guide](/concepts/creatives) for how to make these.
  </Step>

  <Step title="You know your goal">
    For your first campaign, your goal is simple: **get app installs and learn**.

    You're NOT trying to:
    - ~~Go viral~~
    - ~~Make money immediately~~
    - ~~Find the perfect audience~~

    You ARE trying to:
    - See if people are interested in your app
    - Learn how much an install costs
    - Get comfortable with the ad platform
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The mindset

<Note>
  Think of your first $100-200 in ad spend as **tuition**. You're paying to learn.
  Even if every single ad flopped (unlikely), you'd walk away understanding more about your users than months of guessing.
</Note>
