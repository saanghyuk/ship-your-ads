## The cold truth about "build it and they will come"

They won't. Let's be honest with each other right from the start.

Here's the reality you're facing: the App Store currently has approximately **2.1 million apps**. Google Play has roughly **2.2 million apps**. That's over **4.3 million apps** competing for attention across the two major stores.

Let that number sink in for a second. **4.3 million.**

Your beautifully crafted, thoughtfully designed, lovingly vibe-coded app is one of 4.3 million. It's not a needle in a haystack — it's a needle in a haystack the size of a continent.

<Warning>
  The #1 reason apps fail isn't bad code, bad design, or bad timing. It's **nobody finding out they exist**. Study after study confirms this. CB Insights found that "no market need" (which often really means "couldn't reach the people who needed it") is the top startup killer. For apps specifically, discoverability is the single biggest challenge.
</Warning>

Think about your own behavior. When was the last time you browsed the App Store just... looking around? You probably haven't. Most people find apps through three channels: someone recommends it, they see it on social media, or they search for a specific problem. If you're not showing up in any of those places, you're invisible.

## The organic growth myth

"But wait," you might say. "What about organic growth? What about going viral? What about Product Hunt?"

Organic growth is real. It absolutely exists. But let's look at what it actually takes, with honest timelines and realistic expectations:

| Strategy | Time to 1,000 users | Actual cost | Reliability | What it really takes |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Word of mouth | 6-18 months | Free (in money) | Very low | An incredibly sticky product AND lucky early users who love telling people about apps |
| App Store Optimization (ASO) | 3-6 months | Time-intensive | Low-Medium | Keyword research, constant iteration on screenshots and descriptions, competing with established apps |
| SEO / Content marketing | 4-12 months | Very time-intensive | Medium | Writing 50+ blog posts, building backlinks, waiting for Google to index and rank your content |
| Social media posting | 3-6 months | Time-intensive | Low | Daily posting on multiple platforms, engaging with communities, going viral is not a strategy |
| Product Hunt launch | 1 day spike, then back to zero | Time for preparation | Very low | One day of traffic that almost always drops to nothing the next week |
| Reddit / Forum posting | Unpredictable | Time + risk of being banned for self-promotion | Very low | Walking the fine line between helpful and spammy, subreddit rules vary wildly |
| **Paid ads** | **1-4 weeks** | **$50-500 to start** | **High** | **Following a guide like this one, spending 30 min to set up, then letting the platform do the work** |

<Tip>
**Pro Tip from Eric Seufert (Mobile Dev Memo):** "Organic and paid acquisition aren't enemies — they're partners. Paid ads actually *boost* your organic rankings. When you drive installs through ads, app stores see increased velocity and tend to rank you higher organically. The best growth strategies use paid to kickstart organic." This is sometimes called the "paid-organic halo effect."
</Tip>

Here's the thing about organic growth that nobody tells you: **it's not actually free.** Every hour you spend writing blog posts, crafting tweets, and optimizing App Store screenshots is an hour you're not spending improving your app. Your time has value. If you're a developer who could be freelancing at $50-100/hour, spending 40 hours on organic marketing "for free" actually cost you $2,000-4,000 in opportunity cost.

Meanwhile, $200 in ads could get you the same (or more) users in a fraction of the time.

---

## "But ads are expensive!" — Let's do the actual math

This is the most common objection, and it's the most easily debunked. Let's break down real numbers.

### The cost of acquiring one user

The global average Cost Per Install (CPI) varies by platform:

- **iOS**: approximately **$3.6** per install (global average, 2024-2025 data)
- **Android**: approximately **$1.2** per install (global average, 2024-2025 data)

These are averages across all categories and all regions. Your actual CPI can be much lower depending on your targeting, your creative quality, and your app category.

<Note>
These CPI figures are industry averages from multiple data sources including Liftoff, Airbridge, AppsFlyer, and Adjust reports. Your actual costs will vary based on your app category, target geography, creative quality, and competition. Gaming apps tend to have lower CPIs; fintech and e-commerce apps tend to have higher ones.
</Note>

### The $10/day math

Let's say you're on a tight budget. You can only spare $10 a day. Here's what that looks like on Android (using the $1.2 average CPI):

```
Daily budget:     $10/day
Average CPI:      $1.2 (Android, global average)
Daily installs:   $10 ÷ $1.2 = ~8 installs/day

Weekly:           ~56 installs for $70
Monthly:          ~240 installs for $300

That's 240 real users in your first month, for about $300.
```

Now let's look at iOS (higher CPI, but often higher-value users):

```
Daily budget:     $10/day
Average CPI:      $3.6 (iOS, global average)
Daily installs:   $10 ÷ $3.6 = ~3 installs/day

Weekly:           ~21 installs for $70
Monthly:          ~90 installs for $300
```

And here's the thing — these are averages. If your ad creative is good and your targeting is dialed in, you can beat these averages significantly. Many indie developers report CPIs 30-50% below industry average with well-crafted campaigns.

<Tip>
**Pro Tip from the Ship Your Ads team:** Start with Android if you're budget-constrained. The CPI is roughly 3x lower than iOS, which means you get 3x more users for the same budget. This gives you more data to learn from, faster. Once you've optimized your campaign and know what works, then expand to iOS.
</Tip>

### The $20/day math (our recommended starting point)

With $20/day — which is about the cost of a Netflix subscription and a couple of coffees — the numbers get more exciting:

```
Platform: Meta (Facebook/Instagram) — Android targeting
Daily budget:     $20/day
Expected CPI:     $0.80 - $1.50 (with decent creative)
Daily installs:   13-25 installs/day

In one week:      91-175 new users for $140
In one month:     390-750 new users for $600

That's potentially 100+ users per week for $140.
```

$140 a week. That's it. For 100+ real human beings downloading your app, opening it, and using it.

## Addressing every objection (honestly)

We know you have doubts. Every developer does. Let's address them one by one, with complete honesty.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="'I don't have money for ads'">
    We hear you. Budgets are real, especially for indie developers.

    But let's reframe this. Here are the actual minimum budgets for each major platform:

    - **Meta (Facebook/Instagram)**: Technically as low as **$5/day**, though **$10-20/day** is recommended for the algorithm to have enough data to optimize
    - **Google Ads**: No official minimum daily budget; Google recommends **$10-50/day** depending on your goals
    - **TikTok Ads**: **$20/day minimum** at the ad group level, with a **$500 campaign lifetime minimum**
    - **Apple Search Ads**: No minimum budget, and the average Cost Per Tap (CPT) is around **$2.50** (2024 data)

    So the real question isn't "Can I afford ads?" It's "Can I afford to skip my morning coffee for a week?" Because $5-10/day is genuinely enough to start learning.

    Here's our honest advice: if $5/day is truly too much right now, that's okay. Focus on organic channels first, save up $100-200, and come back to this guide when you're ready. But don't wait for months hoping organic will magically work.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'Ads are annoying — I don't want to be that person'">
    This is actually one of the most thoughtful objections, and it shows you care about user experience. That's great.

    But here's a perspective shift: **good ads aren't annoying. Bad ads are annoying.** Think about it — have you ever seen an ad for a product that was genuinely relevant to you, and you were actually glad you saw it? That's what good targeting does.

    When you run ads for your app, you're not spamming random people. You're putting your app in front of people who are **actively looking for something like what you built**. Someone who searches "best meditation app" on Google and sees your meditation app ad — that's not annoying. That's helpful.

    The advertisers who create annoying ads are the ones with bad targeting, misleading creatives, and clickbait. That's not going to be you, because you actually care about your users.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'My app will grow organically if it's good enough'">
    This is the most dangerous myth in the app world, and it's completely understandable why you believe it. We all love stories about apps that "went viral."

    But survivorship bias is real. For every app that grew purely organically, there are **thousands** of equally good (or better) apps that never got discovered. The apps that "went viral" almost always had something else going on: a famous founder with a huge Twitter following, a feature in the App Store (which Apple controls), a lucky Reddit post that happened to blow up, or — surprise — paid advertising that kickstarted their growth.

    Here's the uncomfortable truth: **quality is necessary but not sufficient.** Your app needs to be good, yes. But being good doesn't guarantee discovery. The App Store is not a meritocracy — it's an attention economy.

    Paid ads don't replace quality. They amplify it. If your app is great, ads help people find it. If your app isn't great yet, ads will tell you fast (through poor retention data), and you can go fix it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'I'll just do social media marketing instead'">
    You absolutely can, and you should — as a complement to ads, not a replacement.

    But let's be honest about what social media marketing actually requires:

    - **Consistency**: You need to post high-quality content 3-7 times per week, for months
    - **Time**: Creating good social content takes 1-2 hours per post (writing, designing, editing)
    - **Platform knowledge**: Each platform (Twitter/X, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn) has different best practices
    - **Patience**: It typically takes 3-6 months to build an audience that converts to users
    - **No guarantees**: You can post great content for months and still not get traction

    Compare that to ads:
    - **30 minutes** to set up your first campaign
    - **Results in 24-48 hours** (not months)
    - **Predictable**: spend X, get approximately Y users
    - **Scalable**: working? Spend more. Not working? Pause immediately.

    The smartest strategy is to use ads for immediate user acquisition while building your organic presence over time. Don't choose one or the other.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'What if I waste my money and get zero results?'">
    This is a totally valid fear. Let's address it directly.

    First: you will not get "zero results" unless you do something fundamentally wrong (like targeting the wrong country or forgetting to add a link to your app). Even a mediocre campaign will get you some installs and, more importantly, **data**.

    Second: every ad platform has safeguards:
    - You set a **daily budget cap** — you literally cannot spend more than you authorize
    - You can **pause any campaign instantly** — if something looks wrong, one click stops everything
    - You only pay for results (clicks or installs, depending on your setup) — if nobody engages, you don't pay

    Third: even a "failed" campaign teaches you something. If nobody clicks your ad, that tells you your creative needs work. If people click but don't install, that tells you your app store page needs improvement. Data is never wasted.

    Our suggestion: start with $50-100 as a "learning budget." Think of it as tuition for a crash course in user acquisition. The knowledge you gain is worth far more than $100.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'I'll wait until my app is more polished'">
    We understand the impulse to make everything perfect before showing it to the world. Developers are perfectionists by nature.

    But here's the counterargument: **ads give you the fastest feedback loop possible.** Running ads to an imperfect app tells you what users actually care about. Maybe the feature you spent 3 weeks polishing doesn't matter to anyone, and the quick feature you threw together is what people love.

    Many successful app developers use a "launch and learn" approach:
    1. Ship a solid MVP
    2. Run small ad campaigns to get real users
    3. Watch what users actually do (not what you think they'll do)
    4. Improve based on real data
    5. Repeat

    Waiting for perfection is a form of procrastination. Your users will tell you what "polished" means to them — but only if they can find your app first.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What ads actually do for you

Okay, so we've addressed the objections. Now let's talk about the positive case. What do you actually *get* from running ads?

### 1. Speed — users today, not in 6 months

Ads put your app in front of thousands of real people **today**. Not in 6 months after you've written 50 blog posts. Not after your 200th tweet. Today.

You can literally set up a campaign this afternoon and have new users downloading your app by tonight. That speed is transformative, especially when you're trying to validate an idea or hit a milestone.

### 2. Precision — reach exactly the right people

This is where ads are almost magical. You don't just reach "people." You reach **the exact people who are most likely to want your app**:

- Building a meditation app? Target people who follow Headspace and Calm, or who've searched for "reduce anxiety."
- Built a recipe app? Target people who watch cooking videos, follow food bloggers, or search for "easy dinner recipes."
- Made a fitness tracker? Target people who've recently purchased running shoes, joined a gym, or downloaded competing fitness apps.
- Created a budgeting app? Target people interested in personal finance, Dave Ramsey, or "save money tips."

No organic channel gives you this level of precision. When you post on social media, you're shouting into the void and hoping the right people hear you. With ads, you're whispering directly into the ears of people who already care about what you built.

### 3. Data — learn what your users actually want

Every ad campaign is a research project disguised as marketing. Here's what you learn:

- **Who are your real users?** You might think your app is for college students, but your data shows 35-44 year olds convert best.
- **What message resonates?** "Save 2 hours per week" might outperform "The smartest productivity app" by 3x.
- **What do they look like?** Your best users might be from a completely different demographic than you expected.
- **How much is a user worth?** Once you know your CPI and retention rates, you can calculate the lifetime value of a user and build a real business model.

<Tip>
**Pro Tip from Andrew Chen (General Partner at a16z, former VP Growth at Uber):** "The best founders treat their early ad spend as market research, not marketing. The data you get from even a small campaign — who clicks, who converts, what messaging works — is worth 10x the ad spend itself. You're paying for information, not just installs."
</Tip>

### 4. Control — a lever you can pull anytime

Unlike organic growth (which is unpredictable and slow to adjust), ads give you precise controls:

- **Want more users?** Increase your daily budget. Results scale roughly proportionally.
- **Getting the wrong users?** Adjust your targeting. Narrow your audience or exclude certain demographics.
- **One ad performing great, another flopping?** Pause the bad one, put more budget into the good one.
- **Need to slow down?** (Maybe your server can't handle the load.) Reduce your budget or pause entirely.
- **Campaign not working at all?** Pause it. You stop spending immediately. No contracts, no minimums, no commitments.

This level of control is something organic growth simply cannot offer. You can't tell a blog post to generate more traffic. You can't tell a tweet to go viral. But you can tell an ad campaign to spend $50 more today.

### 5. Compounding effects — ads make everything else work better

Here's something most guides don't mention: running ads improves your organic growth too.

- **App Store ranking boost**: More installs (even paid ones) signal to the App Store that your app is gaining traction. This can improve your ranking in search results, leading to more organic discovery.
- **Social proof**: "10,000+ downloads" looks a lot better than "10 downloads" to someone browsing the App Store.
- **Review velocity**: More users means more reviews. More (positive) reviews means better conversion from your app store page.
- **Word of mouth**: Every user you acquire through ads can tell their friends. Your paid users become the seed for organic growth.

## Real-world context: what successful indie developers do

Let's look at how real indie developers approach advertising (generalized patterns from publicly shared strategies):

**The "Validate Fast" approach** — Many solo developers spend $100-200 in the first week after launching to quickly learn if there's demand for their app. If the CPI is reasonable and retention looks good, they increase the budget. If not, they go back to the drawing board. This approach saves months of building features nobody wants.

**The "Slow and Steady" approach** — Some developers set a fixed monthly budget ($200-500/month) and run ads continuously. They treat it like a subscription: a predictable cost that brings a predictable number of users. Over 6 months, this can mean 1,000-3,000+ users with minimal daily effort.

**The "Launch Spike" approach** — Others save up and spend aggressively during launch week ($50-100/day for 7-10 days) to create a burst of downloads. This can help with App Store featuring and creates social proof fast. Then they reduce to a maintenance budget.

<Tip>
**Pro Tip from Thomas Petit (mobile growth consultant):** "For indie developers, I always recommend starting with $10-20/day on a single platform. Don't spread your budget across 3 platforms. Pick one (usually Meta for broad reach or Apple Search Ads for high intent), learn it deeply, and only expand when you've exhausted the opportunities there."
</Tip>

## The simple formula

Here's the beautiful thing about ads. Once you find a combination that works, the formula is simple:

```
If acquiring a user costs you $2 (CPI)
And each user generates $5 in lifetime value (LTV)
Then every $1 you spend on ads returns $2.50

That's not an expense. That's an investment with a 150% return.
```

The goal of this guide is to help you find that formula for your app. Some apps get there in a week. Some take a month of experimentation. But once you crack the code, scaling is just a matter of increasing your budget.

<Warning>
**Honesty check**: Not every app will have positive unit economics from ads. If your app is free with no monetization, the math is different (you'll need to add monetization first or view ads as a brand-building investment). This guide will help you figure out your numbers so you can make informed decisions, not throw money into the void.
</Warning>

## Minimum budgets at a glance

Before we move on, here's a quick reference for what each major platform requires:

| Platform | Minimum budget | Recommended starting budget | Best for |
|----------|---------------|---------------------------|----------|
| **Meta (Facebook/Instagram)** | $5/day (technical minimum) | $10-20/day | Broad reach, visual apps, social apps |
| **Google Ads** | No official minimum | $10-50/day (Google's recommendation) | High-intent users (search), wide reach (display/YouTube) |
| **TikTok Ads** | $20/day (ad group level), $500 campaign minimum | $20-50/day | Young demographics, viral-style content, entertainment apps |
| **Apple Search Ads** | No minimum budget | $10-30/day | High-intent iOS users actively searching the App Store |

<Note>
**Which platform should you start with?** If you're not sure, start with Meta (Facebook/Instagram). It has the largest audience, the most sophisticated targeting, the best machine learning for optimization, and it works for almost every app category. We'll cover platform selection in detail in the [Choose Your Platform](/first-campaign/choose-your-platform) section.
