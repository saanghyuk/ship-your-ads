## The cold truth about "build it and they will come"

They won't.

The App Store has **2 million+ apps**. Google Play has **3.5 million+**.
Your beautifully crafted vibe-coded app is a needle in a haystack the size of a planet.

<Warning>
  The #1 reason apps fail isn't bad code. It's **nobody finding out about them**.
</Warning>

## But what about organic growth?

Sure, organic growth exists. Here's what it actually looks like:

| Strategy | Time to 1,000 users | Cost | Reliability |
|----------|---------------------|------|-------------|
| Word of mouth | 6-12 months | Free | Low |
| SEO / Content marketing | 3-6 months | Time-intensive | Medium |
| Social media posting | 3-6 months | Time-intensive | Low |
| **Paid ads** | **1-2 weeks** | **$50-500** | **High** |

<Tip>
  Organic and paid aren't enemies. The best strategy is: **use ads to get your first users fast**, then build organic over time.
</Tip>

## What ads actually do for you

### 1. Speed

Ads put your app in front of thousands of people **today**. Not in 6 months. Today.

### 2. Precision

You don't just reach "people." You reach **the exact people who are most likely to want your app**.

- Building a meditation app? Target people who follow Headspace.
- Built a recipe app? Target people who search for "easy dinner recipes."
- Made a fitness tracker? Target people who just bought running shoes.

### 3. Data

Every ad campaign gives you real data about your users:
- Who clicks? Who doesn't?
- What message resonates?
- How much does it cost to get one user?

This data is **gold**. It tells you what your users actually want — not what you *think* they want.

### 4. Control

Unlike organic growth, ads give you a knob you can turn:
- Want more users? Turn up the budget.
- Getting the wrong users? Adjust your targeting.
- Campaign not working? Pause it. Lose nothing.

## "But I'm just one developer..."

That's the beauty of modern ad platforms. You don't need:
- ~~A marketing team~~
- ~~An agency~~
- ~~A massive budget~~
- ~~A marketing degree~~

You need:
- **$5-10/day** to start
- **This guide** to know what to do
- **30 minutes** to set up your first campaign
