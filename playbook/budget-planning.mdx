## How much should you spend?

This is the #1 question every new advertiser asks. The honest answer: **it depends.** But we can give you a practical framework so you're not guessing.

The goal isn't to spend the most — it's to spend **enough to learn** what works, then scale what's profitable.

## What you'll learn

- How to determine your starting budget
- How to allocate budget across platforms
- How to calculate your target CPI and ROAS
- When to increase, decrease, or redistribute budget
- Common budgeting mistakes to avoid

## The minimum viable budget

You need enough budget for the ad platform's algorithm to learn. Below certain thresholds, you're just burning money slowly.

| Platform | Minimum daily budget | Minimum monthly budget | Why |
|----------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----|
| **Meta** | $10/day | $300/month | Need 50 conversions/week for algorithm optimization |
| **Google** | $10/day | $300/month | Similar learning requirements |
| **Apple Search Ads** | $5/day | $150/month | Lower minimums, higher intent |
| **TikTok** | $20/day | $600/month | Higher minimums, needs volume |

<Note>
  **If your total budget is under $500/month**, pick ONE platform and focus. Spreading $500 across 4 platforms gives none of them enough data to optimize. Start with Meta or Apple Search Ads.
</Note>

## How to set your target CPI

Your target Cost Per Install should be based on what a user is worth to you:

```
LTV (Lifetime Value of a user) × Target ROAS = Maximum CPI

Example:
  Average user generates $8 in revenue over their lifetime
  You want 2x return on ad spend
  Max CPI = $8 ÷ 2 = $4.00
```

### If you don't know your LTV yet

That's okay — most early-stage apps don't. Use these starting points:

| App monetization | Rough LTV estimate | Suggested starting CPI |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **In-app purchases** | $3-15 | $1-5 |
| **Subscription** | $10-50 | $3-15 |
| **Ad-supported (free)** | $1-5 | $0.50-2 |
| **Paid app** | App price × 1 | Below app price |

<Tip>
  **Track your LTV from day one.** Even rough numbers are better than nothing. Use cohort analysis to see how much revenue users generate at 7 days, 30 days, and 90 days after install. This data becomes your most valuable budgeting tool.
</Tip>

## Budget allocation across platforms

Once you have a monthly budget, here's how to split it:

### For beginners ($300-1,000/month)

```
100% → One platform (Meta or Apple Search Ads)
```

Focus and learn. Don't spread thin.

### For growing apps ($1,000-5,000/month)

```
60% → Primary platform (your best performer)
25% → Secondary platform (testing)
15% → Experimental (new platform or creative tests)
```

### For scaling apps ($5,000+/month)

```
40% → Meta (broad reach + retargeting)
25% → Google (high-intent search + app campaigns)
20% → Apple Search Ads (iOS optimization)
15% → TikTok or other channels
```

## The budget scaling framework

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test phase ($300-500/month)">
    Run small campaigns on one platform. Goal: find winning creative and audiences. Expect to lose money here — it's tuition.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validation phase ($500-2,000/month)">
    Scale winning campaigns. Confirm that your CPI stays below your target as you increase budget. Add a second platform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Growth phase ($2,000-10,000/month)">
    Multiple platforms, multiple campaigns. Optimize for ROAS, not just CPI. Budget follows performance — more money to what works.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scale phase ($10,000+/month)">
    Broad testing, creative volume, full-funnel approach. You're now optimizing entire funnels, not just individual campaigns.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  <Card title="Spreading too thin" icon="arrows-split-up-and-left">
    $100/month across 4 platforms = nothing works. Concentrate your budget until you find what works.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cutting too early" icon="scissors">
    Pausing a campaign after 3 days because "it's not working" doesn't give the algorithm time to learn. Wait at least 7 days.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No safety net" icon="parachute-box">
    Always set spending limits. One misconfigured campaign can drain your credit card overnight.

  <Card title="Ignoring seasonality" icon="calendar">
    Ad costs spike during Q4 (holidays), back-to-school, and major events. Plan your budget accordingly.

<Warning>
  **The first $500 is learning money.** Treat it as an investment in data, not a direct revenue generator. The insights you gain about your audience, creative, and platform are worth far more than the installs you get.
