## Don't let interested users slip away

Most people don't convert on the first touchpoint. They visit your website, check your App Store page, maybe even install but never open the app. **Retargeting brings them back.**

Retargeting campaigns typically have 2-5x better conversion rates and lower costs than prospecting campaigns — because you're reaching people who already showed interest.

## What you'll learn

- What retargeting is and why it's so effective
- Different retargeting audiences and how to set them up
- Retargeting strategies for each stage of the funnel
- How to create retargeting campaigns on each platform
- Frequency caps and best practices to avoid annoying users

## How retargeting works

```
User visits your website / sees your ad / installs your app
    → They leave without converting (or go dormant)
        → Your tracking pixel/SDK records this
            → You show them targeted ads reminding them to come back
                → They convert at a much higher rate
```

## Retargeting audiences by funnel stage

| Stage | Audience | Goal | Example message |
|-------|---------|------|----------------|
| **Awareness** | Video viewers (25%+ watched) | Drive to website/store | "Liked what you saw? Here's more." |
| **Consideration** | Website visitors (no install) | Drive install | "Still thinking about it? Try it free." |
| **Activation** | Installed but not signed up | Drive registration | "You're almost there — finish setting up." |
| **Retention** | Signed up but inactive (7-30 days) | Re-engage | "We've added new features since your last visit." |
| **Revenue** | Active users who haven't purchased | Drive purchase | "Unlock premium for 50% off this week." |

<Tip>
  **The closer someone is to converting, the more you should spend to retarget them.** Website visitors who spent 2+ minutes on your site are worth more than someone who glanced at a 5-second video. Allocate budget accordingly.
</Tip>

## Setting up retargeting on each platform

### Meta

1. Go to **Audiences** > **Create Custom Audience**
2. Choose your source:
   - **Website traffic** — people who visited specific pages
   - **App activity** — people who installed, opened, or took actions
   - **Video views** — people who watched your video ads
3. Set your time window (7, 14, 30, or 90 days)
4. Use this audience in a new campaign with retargeting-specific creative

### Google

1. Go to **Tools** > **Audience Manager**
2. Create a remarketing list from:
   - **Website visitors** (via Google Tag)
   - **App users** (via Firebase)
   - **YouTube viewers**
3. Apply the audience to a Display or Search campaign

### TikTok

1. Go to **Assets** > **Audiences**
2. Create a custom audience from:
   - **App activity**
   - **Website traffic** (via TikTok Pixel)
   - **Engagement** (ad interactions, video views)

<Note>
  **Apple Search Ads doesn't support traditional retargeting**, but you can target users who've downloaded your app before with "Returning Users" campaigns — useful for re-engagement after updates.
</Note>

## Retargeting creative best practices

Retargeting ads should be different from your prospecting ads. These people already know you — talk to them accordingly:

  <Card title="Acknowledge them" icon="hand-wave">
    "Still interested in [App Name]?" is better than treating them like a stranger. Show you know they've been around.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Address objections" icon="shield">
    If they didn't convert, there's a reason. Address common objections: price, complexity, time commitment. "Try it free for 7 days — no credit card needed."
  </Card>
  <Card title="Create urgency" icon="clock">
    Limited-time offers, expiring discounts, or "before the new version launches" can push fence-sitters to act.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Show social proof" icon="star">
    Reviews, testimonials, and user counts reduce uncertainty. "Join 50K+ users who already made the switch."

## Frequency caps: don't be creepy

Retargeting can cross the line from helpful to annoying very quickly. Set frequency caps:

| Audience warmth | Recommended frequency | Time window |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Hot** (visited this week) | 1-2 times/day | 7 days |
| **Warm** (visited this month) | 3-5 times/week | 14 days |
| **Cool** (visited 30+ days ago) | 1-2 times/week | 30 days |

<Warning>
  **If someone sees your retargeting ad 10+ times and doesn't convert, showing it 10 more times won't help.** Excessive retargeting damages brand perception. Set frequency caps and respect them.
</Warning>

## Budget allocation for retargeting

Retargeting should be a portion of your total budget — not the majority:

```
Total ad budget
├── 70-80% → Prospecting (finding new users)
├── 15-25% → Retargeting (bringing back interested users)
└── 5% → Re-engagement (lapsed users)
```

Retargeting audiences are smaller, so they need less budget. But the ROI per dollar is typically much higher.
