description: "The complete guide to retargeting — bring back users who visited your site, saw your ad, installed but churned, or showed interest but didn't convert. Includes setup for every major platform."
---

## Don't let interested users slip away

Most people don't convert on the first touchpoint. They visit your website, check your App Store page, maybe even install but never open the app. **Retargeting brings them back.** It's the art of showing relevant ads to people who already know you exist.

Retargeting campaigns typically have **2-5x better conversion rates** and **lower costs** than prospecting campaigns — because you're reaching people who already showed interest. They just need a nudge.

## How retargeting works

Here's the big picture of what happens:

```

<Note>
  **Retargeting isn't creepy — it's helpful (when done right).** Think about it from the user's perspective: they looked at your app, were interested, but got distracted. A gentle reminder a few days later is often welcome. It only becomes creepy when you do it too aggressively or for too long. That's why frequency caps matter.
</Note>

## Funnel-stage retargeting

The most effective retargeting strategy treats different users differently based on where they are in the funnel. Someone who watched 50% of your video ad is very different from someone who installed your app and churned after a week.

### The retargeting funnel

```
     ┌───────────────────────────────────────┐
     │           AWARENESS                    │
     │   Video viewers, ad engagers           │  ← Largest audience,
     │   Goal: Move to consideration          │     lowest intent
     ├───────────────────────────────────────┤
     │         CONSIDERATION                  │
     │   Website visitors, store viewers      │  ← Medium audience,
     │   Goal: Drive install                  │     medium intent
     ├───────────────────────────────────────┤
     │         ACTIVATION                     │
     │   Installed but not signed up          │  ← Small audience,
     │   Goal: Complete onboarding            │     high intent
     ├───────────────────────────────────────┤
     │          RETENTION                     │
     │   Signed up but inactive (7-30d)       │  ← Small audience,
     │   Goal: Re-engage                      │     was engaged
     ├───────────────────────────────────────┤
     │           REVENUE                      │
     │   Active but hasn't purchased          │  ← Smallest audience,
     │   Goal: Upsell / convert to paid       │     highest value
     └───────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Strategy for each funnel stage

| Stage | Audience definition | Time window | Message strategy | Example ad |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Awareness** | Watched 25%+ of your video ad, or engaged with your social content | 1-14 days | Deepen interest, show more value | "Liked what you saw? Here's how [App] helped 50K people save money." |
| **Consideration** | Visited your website or App Store page but didn't install | 1-30 days | Address objections, reduce friction | "Still thinking about it? Try [App] free for 7 days — no credit card needed." |
| **Activation** | Installed the app but didn't complete sign-up or onboarding | 1-14 days | Remind and motivate to finish setup | "You're 90% there! Finish setting up [App] and start seeing results." |
| **Retention** | Completed onboarding but hasn't opened the app in 7-30 days | 7-60 days | Show new features, remind of value | "We've added 3 new features since your last visit. Come see what's new!" |
| **Revenue** | Active user who hasn't made a purchase | 7-30 days | Offer incentive, show premium value | "Unlock Pro for 50% off this week. Get [premium feature] and [premium feature]." |

<Tip>
  **The closer someone is to converting, the more you should spend per impression to retarget them.** A user who installed your app and completed onboarding is worth 10x more in retargeting budget than someone who watched 3 seconds of your video. Weight your budget accordingly.
</Tip>

## Setting up retargeting on each platform

### Meta (Facebook & Instagram)

Meta has the most powerful retargeting capabilities. Here's how to set it up:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the Meta Pixel on your website (if you have one)">
    ```javascript
    // Add this to your website's <head> tag
    // Replace YOUR_PIXEL_ID with your actual pixel ID from Meta Events Manager

    !function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s)
    {if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod?
    n.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)};
    if(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n;n.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version='2.0';
    n.queue=[];t=b.createElement(e);t.async=!0;
    t.src=v;s=b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0];
    s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}(window, document,'script',
    'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/fbevents.js');
    fbq('init', 'YOUR_PIXEL_ID');
    fbq('track', 'PageView');
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Meta SDK in your app">
    Follow the SDK Integration Guide for the full setup. The SDK automatically tracks installs and app opens.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Custom Audiences in Meta Ads Manager">
    Go to **Audiences** > **Create Audience** > **Custom Audience** and choose your source:

    **Website Custom Audience:**
    - All website visitors (last 30 days)
    - Visitors to specific pages (e.g., pricing page)
    - Visitors by time spent (top 25% by time on site)

    **App Activity Custom Audience:**
    - Anyone who opened your app
    - People who completed specific events (sign-up, add-to-cart)
    - People who haven't opened in X days (lapsed users)
    - People who purchased (for exclusion OR upsell)

    **Engagement Custom Audience:**
    - People who watched 25/50/75/95% of your video ads
    - People who engaged with your Facebook/Instagram page
    - People who opened or completed a lead form
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create retargeting campaigns">
    Create a new campaign with these settings:

    ```
    Campaign objective:   App Installs (for consideration stage)
                          OR Conversions (for revenue stage)
    Audience:             Your Custom Audience from Step 3
    Exclusions:           Exclude people who already converted
                          (e.g., exclude purchasers from install campaign)
    Budget:               15-25% of your total ad budget
    Placements:           Automatic (Meta distributes to best placements)
    Creative:             Retargeting-specific ads (NOT your prospecting ads)
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Meta retargeting audience recipes

| Audience name | Source | Definition | Use for |
|---------------|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Video Engagers** | Engagement | Watched 50%+ of any video ad, last 14 days | Moving awareness → consideration |
| **Website Visitors** | Website (Pixel) | Visited any page, last 30 days, excluding installers | Driving installs |
| **App Installers - Not Signed Up** | App Activity | Installed app, did NOT complete registration event, last 14 days | Driving activation |
| **Lapsed Users** | App Activity | Completed registration, last app open > 14 days ago | Re-engagement |
| **Free Users** | App Activity | Active in last 30 days, no purchase event | Upsell to premium |

### Google Ads

Google offers retargeting through Display, YouTube, and Search campaigns:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up Google Tag on your website">
    ```html
    <!-- Add to <head> -->
    <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=AW-YOUR_CONVERSION_ID"></script>
    <script>
      window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
      function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
      gtag('js', new Date());
      gtag('config', 'AW-YOUR_CONVERSION_ID');
    </script>
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link Firebase to Google Ads">
    In Firebase Console > **Project Settings** > **Integrations** > **Google Ads**, link your accounts. This automatically shares app audiences.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create remarketing audiences in Google Ads">
    Go to **Tools & Settings** > **Audience Manager** > **Your data segments**:

    **Website visitors:**
    - All visitors (last 30 days)
    - Visitors to specific URLs
    - Visitors who completed a conversion

    **App users (via Firebase link):**
    - All app users
    - Users who completed specific events
    - Users who haven't used the app in X days
    - Purchasers (for exclusion or upsell)

    **YouTube viewers:**
    - Watched any video from your channel
    - Watched specific videos
    - Subscribed to your channel
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create remarketing campaigns">
    ```
    Campaign type:    Display (for visual retargeting)
                      OR Search (for search retargeting)
                      OR Video (for YouTube retargeting)
    Audience:         Your remarketing segment from Step 3
    Exclusions:       Exclude converters
    Budget:           15-20% of your Google Ads budget
    Bidding:          Target CPA or Maximize Conversions
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### TikTok

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install TikTok Pixel on your website">
    Go to **Assets** > **Events** > **Website Pixel** and follow the setup wizard. Add the pixel code to your website's `<head>`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install TikTok SDK in your app">
    Follow the SDK Integration Guide for the full setup.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Custom Audiences">
    Go to **Assets** > **Audiences** > **Create Audience** > **Custom Audience**:

    **App Activity:**
    - App install
    - App open
    - Specific in-app events
    - Inactive users (no activity in X days)

    **Website Traffic (Pixel):**
    - All visitors
    - Visitors to specific pages
    - Visitors who completed events

    **Engagement:**
    - Viewed your ad
    - Clicked your ad
    - Watched 2s/6s/full video
    - Engaged with your TikTok profile
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create retargeting ad groups">
    ```
    Campaign objective:   App Installs or Conversions
    Audience:             Your Custom Audience
    Exclusions:           Exclude people who already converted
    Budget:               $20+/day minimum
    Creative:             TikTok-native retargeting content
    Note:                 TikTok retargeting audiences can be small —
                          if audience is under 1,000, combine segments
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Apple Search Ads

<Note>
  **Apple Search Ads doesn't support traditional retargeting in the same way as Meta, Google, or TikTok.** However, you can set up "Returning Users" campaigns to target people who previously downloaded your app but may have deleted it. This is useful for re-engagement after major updates.

  To set this up: When creating a campaign, under **Customer Type**, select **"Returning Users"** (users who have downloaded your app before).
</Note>

## Retargeting creative best practices

Retargeting ads must be **different** from your prospecting ads. These people already know you — talk to them accordingly.

### Prospecting vs. retargeting creative

| Element | Prospecting ad | Retargeting ad |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| **Tone** | Introduce yourself, explain what you do | Assume familiarity, address the "why not?" |
| **Hook** | "Discover the app that..." | "Still thinking about [App]?" |
| **Content** | Features, benefits, differentiation | Objection handling, social proof, urgency |
| **CTA** | "Learn More" or "Try Free" | "Come Back" or "Claim Your Offer" |
| **Offer** | Usually none | Discount, extended trial, bonus feature |
| **Creative style** | Broad appeal, attention-grabbing | Personalized, reminder-style |

### Retargeting creative strategies by funnel stage

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Acknowledge them" icon="hand-wave">
    "Still interested in [App Name]?" Show that you know they've been around. This feels personal (in a good way) and re-establishes the connection. Works best for consideration stage.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Address objections" icon="shield">
    If they didn't convert, there's a reason. Address common objections directly: "No credit card required." "Set up in 2 minutes." "Free forever — paid plan optional." Remove the friction.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Create urgency" icon="clock">
    Limited-time offers, expiring discounts, or countdowns. "Get 50% off Pro — this week only." "The new version launches Friday — get in before prices go up." Push fence-sitters to act.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Show social proof" icon="star">
    Reviews, testimonials, user counts, and app store ratings. "Join 50K+ users who already made the switch." "4.8 stars with 10K+ reviews." Numbers reduce uncertainty.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Show what's new" icon="sparkles">
    For lapsed users, highlight new features or improvements since they last used the app. "We've completely redesigned the dashboard based on your feedback." Makes re-engagement feel fresh.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Offer an incentive" icon="gift">
    For high-value conversion goals (purchases, subscriptions), a direct incentive can justify the investment. "Come back and get your first month free." Only use for bottom-of-funnel audiences.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

[CTA - 3 seconds]
"Upgrade to Pro — 50% off this week only."

Visual: Polished screen recording showing premium features
Length: 15-20 seconds
```
</Accordion>

## Dynamic retargeting

Dynamic retargeting shows users the *specific* products or content they viewed, not just generic ads. It's most useful for e-commerce and content apps.

### When to use dynamic retargeting

| App type | Dynamic retargeting use case |
|----------|---------------------------|
| **E-commerce** | Show the exact products the user viewed or added to cart |
| **Travel** | Show the destinations or hotels the user searched for |
| **Real estate** | Show similar listings to ones the user viewed |
| **Content/media** | Show content recommendations based on viewing history |
| **General app** | Usually not applicable — use standard retargeting instead |

### Setting up dynamic retargeting

Dynamic retargeting requires a **product catalog** connected to your ad platform:

| Platform | Catalog requirement | Setup location |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Meta** | Product catalog in Commerce Manager | Commerce Manager > Catalogs |
| **Google** | Product feed in Merchant Center | Google Merchant Center |
| **TikTok** | Product catalog in TikTok Business Center | Assets > Catalogs |

<Note>
  **Dynamic retargeting is an advanced feature.** If your app doesn't have a product catalog (most non-e-commerce apps don't), standard retargeting with well-crafted creative is just as effective. Don't force dynamic retargeting where it doesn't make sense.
</Note>

## Frequency capping: don't be creepy

Retargeting can cross the line from helpful reminder to stalker energy very quickly. Frequency caps control how often someone sees your retargeting ads.

### Recommended frequency caps

| Audience warmth | Who they are | Max frequency | Time window | Max retargeting duration |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Hot** | Visited this week, engaged with ad | 1-2 impressions/day | 7 days | 14 days |
| **Warm** | Visited this month, watched video | 3-5 impressions/week | 14-21 days | 30 days |
| **Cool** | Visited 30+ days ago | 1-2 impressions/week | 30 days | 60 days |
| **Lapsed app users** | Haven't used app in 30+ days | 2-3 impressions/week | 30 days | 90 days |

### How to set frequency caps on each platform

| Platform | Frequency cap setting | Location |
|----------|---------------------|----------|
| **Meta** | Set at ad set level: Reach & Frequency campaign type, or use Reach objective | Campaign creation > Ad Set > Optimization & Delivery |
| **Google** | Set at campaign level for Display campaigns | Campaign Settings > Additional Settings > Frequency Capping |
| **TikTok** | Set at ad group level | Ad Group > Frequency & Schedule |
| **Apple Search Ads** | No frequency cap setting (managed automatically) | N/A |

<Warning>
  **If someone sees your retargeting ad 10+ times and doesn't convert, showing it 10 more times won't help.** In fact, it will actively damage your brand perception. People who feel "followed" by ads develop negative associations with the brand. Set frequency caps and respect them. If someone doesn't convert after reasonable exposure, move on.
</Warning>

## Exclude converters: critical but often forgotten

One of the most common retargeting mistakes is **showing ads to people who already converted**. This wastes budget and annoys users.

### Exclusion audiences to create

| Campaign type | Who to exclude |
|--------------|---------------|
| **Install campaigns** | People who already installed your app |
| **Sign-up campaigns** | People who already completed registration |
| **Purchase campaigns** | People who already made a purchase (or exclude recent purchasers for 7-14 days) |
| **Re-engagement campaigns** | People who re-engaged in the last 7 days |

### How to set up exclusions

```
On every retargeting campaign:

1. Create a Custom Audience of people who completed the goal action
   → Example: "Purchasers - Last 30 days"

2. In your campaign's ad set / ad group settings, add this audience
   as an EXCLUSION

3. This prevents them from seeing the ad

Why this matters:
→ Saves budget (no impressions wasted on already-converted users)
→ Prevents user annoyance ("I already bought this, stop showing me ads!")
→ Improves campaign metrics (higher conversion rates since you removed
   people who can't convert again)
```

## Budget allocation for retargeting

Retargeting should be a portion of your total budget — not the majority:

```
Total monthly ad budget: $3,000

├── 70-75% → Prospecting ($2,100-2,250)
│   └── Finding NEW users who don't know your app exists
│
├── 15-20% → Retargeting ($450-600)
│   ├── Consideration: Website visitors → install ($200-300)
│   ├── Activation: Installers → sign-up ($100-150)
│   └── Revenue: Active users → purchase ($100-150)
│
└── 5-10% → Re-engagement ($150-300)
    └── Lapsed users → re-open the app
```

### Why not spend more on retargeting?

Retargeting audiences are **small** compared to prospecting audiences. If you allocate too much budget to retargeting:

- You'll hit frequency caps quickly (same people see ads too often)
- CPMs increase as you bid against yourself for a small audience
- You'll exhaust the audience without new prospects to refill it
- The funnel runs dry — retargeting needs prospecting to feed it

<Tip>
  **Think of prospecting and retargeting as a system.** Prospecting fills the top of the funnel (awareness). Retargeting pushes people through each stage. Without prospecting, retargeting audiences shrink. Without retargeting, you lose people who were interested but not ready. You need both.
</Tip>

## Cross-platform retargeting

Users live on multiple platforms. A smart retargeting strategy uses this to your advantage:

### Cross-platform retargeting flow

```
User sees your Meta ad → visits your website
    ↓
Google Display retargeting shows them an ad on news sites
    ↓
User sees your TikTok retargeting ad
    ↓
User searches for your app on App Store
    ↓
Apple Search Ads captures the install

Result: Multiple touchpoints across platforms
        increased the likelihood of conversion
```

### How to implement cross-platform retargeting

| Step | What to do | Why |
|------|-----------|-----|
| 1. Install all tracking pixels/SDKs | Meta Pixel, Google Tag, TikTok Pixel on website; all SDKs in app | Each platform can only retarget users it has tracked |
| 2. Create retargeting audiences on each platform | Each platform will build its own audience from its own tracking data | Audiences will overlap but that's okay at reasonable frequency |
| 3. Use different creative per platform | TikTok-native on TikTok, polished on Meta, text-heavy on Google Search | Each platform has different user expectations |
| 4. Stagger timing | Meta retargeting days 1-7, Google retargeting days 3-14, TikTok retargeting days 7-21 | Avoids overwhelming the user on all platforms simultaneously |
| 5. Monitor combined frequency | Use an MMP or manual tracking to estimate total ad exposure | Total frequency across platforms shouldn't exceed 2-3x per day |

### Example 2: Simple retargeting for a new app (small budget)

<Accordion title="Full campaign setup details">
```
APP: Habit tracking app (subscription, $4.99/month)
TOTAL BUDGET: $600/month

You don't need a 5-campaign funnel when starting out.
Start with ONE retargeting campaign:

CAMPAIGN: Catch the interested ones
  Platform: Meta
  Audience: Combined audience:
    → Video viewers (50%+ watched, last 14 days)
    → Website visitors (last 30 days)
    → App installers who haven't opened in 7+ days
  Excluding: Active users (opened app in last 7 days)
  Budget: $3/day (~$90/month, 15% of total budget)
  Creative: Carousel showing 3 benefits + a testimonial
  CTA: "Try Free" or "Open App" depending on audience

The other $510/month goes to prospecting.

When you scale past $1,500/month total, add separate
retargeting campaigns for each funnel stage.

## Measuring retargeting performance

| Metric | Prospecting benchmark | Retargeting benchmark | Why it's different |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| **CTR** | 1-2% | 2-5% | Users already know you |
| **CPI** | $2-5 | $0.50-2 | Higher conversion rate |
| **Conversion rate** | 2-5% | 10-25% | Warm audience |
| **Frequency** | 1-3 | Keep under 4-5/week | Higher tolerance but still limited |
| **ROAS** | 1-3x | 3-10x | Much more efficient per dollar |

<Warning>
  **Don't compare retargeting ROAS to prospecting ROAS and conclude "retargeting is way better."** Retargeting only works because prospecting filled the funnel. The prospecting campaign that got $0 direct ROAS actually *created* the retargeting audience that got 8x ROAS. They work as a system. Evaluate total blended ROAS across both.
