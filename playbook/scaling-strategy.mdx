## Scaling is not just "spend more money"

You've found a campaign that works. Installs are coming in, the CPI is within your target, users are sticking around. Now you want MORE. But here's the thing: **doubling your budget doesn't double your results.** Scaling requires a strategy.

## What you'll learn

- How to know when you're ready to scale
- Vertical scaling (more budget) vs. horizontal scaling (more campaigns)
- The 20% rule for budget increases
- How to scale across platforms
- When scaling stops working (and what to do about it)

## Are you ready to scale?

Before you scale, confirm these conditions:

| Condition | Why it matters |
|-----------|---------------|
| Campaign out of learning phase for 7+ days | Algorithm is stable |
| CPI consistently below your target | You're profitable |
| Positive ROAS (if tracking revenue) | Revenue exceeds ad spend |
| Creative with stable CTR | Ad fatigue hasn't set in |
| You understand what's working | You can replicate success |

<Warning>
  **Don't scale a campaign you don't understand.** If you're not sure why something is working, scaling it will amplify the confusion. Understand your winners before you pour money into them.
</Warning>

## Vertical scaling: increase budget

The simplest way to scale — give a winning campaign more money.

### The 20% rule

Increase budget by no more than **20% every 3-4 days**. This lets the algorithm adjust without resetting the learning phase.

```
Week 1: $20/day  (baseline)
Week 2: $24/day  (+20%)
Week 3: $29/day  (+20%)
Week 4: $35/day  (+20%)
Week 5: $42/day  (+20%)
Week 8: $72/day  (if still performing)
```

<Note>
  This feels slow, but it's reliable. Jumping from $20/day to $100/day often tanks performance because the algorithm has to relearn at the new budget level. Patience pays.
</Note>

### When to accelerate

If your ROAS is very strong (3x+) and you can't afford to wait, try 30-40% increases every 4-5 days. Monitor closely — if CPI spikes more than 20%, pull back.

## Horizontal scaling: more campaigns

Instead of pumping more money into one campaign, create new ones:

    Take your winning ad and show it to different audiences. Test new interests, demographics, lookalike sizes, or countries.

    Take your winning audience and test new creative angles. Different hooks, formats, or messaging.

    Take your winning concept to a new ad platform. What works on Meta often works on TikTok (with creative adaptation).

    Expand to new countries or regions. Start with English-speaking markets if that's your app's language.

### Horizontal scaling strategy

```
Winning campaign: Meta - US - Fitness Enthusiasts - Video A
                                    ↓
Scale horizontally:
├── Same ad, new audience: Meta - US - Health & Wellness
├── Same ad, new geo: Meta - UK - Fitness Enthusiasts
├── New ad, same audience: Meta - US - Fitness Enthusiasts - Video B
└── Same concept, new platform: TikTok - US - Fitness
```

<Tip>
  **Horizontal scaling is usually more sustainable than vertical scaling.** Instead of pushing one campaign to its limits, you create multiple streams of installs. If one stops working, the others keep going.
</Tip>

## Cross-platform scaling

When it's time to add a new platform:

| Your primary platform | Add next | Why |
|----------------------|----------|-----|
| **Meta** | Apple Search Ads | Catch high-intent iOS users |
| **Apple Search Ads** | Meta | Expand to broader audiences |
| **Google** | Meta | Add social/display reach |
| **Any platform** | TikTok | Tap younger demographics |

### Tips for cross-platform expansion

- **Don't copy-paste.** Each platform has its own creative language. Adapt your winners, don't just repost.
- **Stagger launches.** Add one new platform at a time so you can measure its incremental impact.
- **Watch for overlap.** If you're running on Meta AND TikTok, some users see both. Use attribution tools to avoid double-counting.

## When scaling stops working

Every campaign hits a ceiling. Signs you've maxed out:

| Signal | What it means |
|--------|-------------|
| CPI rising despite no changes | Audience saturation |
| Frequency > 4 | Same people seeing your ad too many times |
| CTR declining over 2+ weeks | Creative fatigue |
| Smaller audience winning over broad | You've exhausted the easy-to-convert users |

### What to do at the ceiling

1. **Refresh creative** — this is almost always the first thing to try
2. **Expand audiences** — go broader or test new segments
3. **Try new platforms** — there are always new users to find
4. **Improve your app** — better retention = higher LTV = you can afford higher CPI
5. **Accept diminishing returns** — at some point, more spending means marginally worse efficiency. That's normal.
