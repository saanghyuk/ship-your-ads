# Analytics Setup

Running ads without analytics is like driving with your eyes closed. You might get somewhere, but you will not know how, and you will probably crash. Analytics tells you what is working, what is not, and where to invest your next dollar.

This guide covers everything from choosing your analytics tools to building dashboards that actually help you make decisions.

<Tip>
**For beginners**: You do not need a complex analytics setup on day one. Start with Firebase Analytics (free, easy, powerful), track 5-10 key events, and build from there. You can always add more sophisticated tools later.
</Tip>

## Choosing Your Analytics Stack

| Tool | Cost | Best For | Difficulty |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Firebase Analytics** | Free | Mobile apps, event tracking, Google Ads integration | Easy |
| **Mixpanel** | Free tier, then paid | Product analytics, funnel analysis, user behavior | Moderate |
| **Amplitude** | Free tier, then paid | Product analytics, cohort analysis | Moderate |
| **Google Analytics 4 (GA4)** | Free | Websites + apps combined | Moderate |
| **MMP Dashboard (Airbridge, AppsFlyer, Adjust)** | Free tier / Paid | Attribution, ad campaign performance, real-time analytics | Easy |
| **Custom (data warehouse + BI tool)** | Varies | Complete flexibility, advanced analysis | Hard |

### Recommended Setup by Stage

| Stage | Analytics Stack |
|---|---|
| **Just starting** | Firebase Analytics only |
| **$1K-$5K/month ad spend** | Firebase + MMP (if multi-platform) |
| **$5K-$20K/month ad spend** | Firebase + MMP + Mixpanel or Amplitude |
| **$20K+/month ad spend** | Firebase + MMP + Product analytics + Data warehouse |

## Firebase Analytics Setup

Firebase is the recommended starting point. It is free, integrates with Google Ads, and provides enough functionality for most apps.

### Installation

See the [SDK Integration Guide](/playbook/sdk-integration) for detailed installation steps. The quick version:

```bash
# React Native
npm install @react-native-firebase/app @react-native-firebase/analytics
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

### Key Events to Track

Track the events that matter for your business. Here are recommendations by app type:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Subscription App">
    | Event | When to Fire | Why It Matters |
    |---|---|---|
    | `app_open` | Every app launch | Measures retention and engagement |
    | `sign_up` | User creates account | Top-of-funnel conversion |
    | `tutorial_complete` | Finishes onboarding | Activation metric |
    | `free_trial_start` | Starts free trial | Trial conversion tracking |
    | `subscription_start` | Converts to paid | Revenue event — optimize ads for this |
    | `subscription_renew` | Monthly/annual renewal | Retention tracking |
    | `subscription_cancel` | Cancels subscription | Churn detection |

    ```typescript
    import analytics from '@react-native-firebase/analytics';

## Building Your Dashboard

### The Essential Metrics Dashboard

Every app needs a dashboard that answers these questions at a glance:

| Section | Metrics | Update Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| **Acquisition** | Daily installs, CPI by platform, install source breakdown | Daily |
| **Activation** | Registration rate, onboarding completion rate | Daily |
| **Engagement** | DAU, MAU, DAU/MAU ratio, sessions per user | Daily |
| **Retention** | Day 1, Day 7, Day 30 retention rates | Weekly |
| **Revenue** | ARPU, ARPPU, LTV, total revenue | Daily |
| **Campaign Performance** | CPI, CPA, ROAS by campaign and platform | Daily |

### Key Formulas

| Metric | Formula | What It Tells You |
|---|---|---|
| **DAU** | Unique users active today | Daily engagement |
| **MAU** | Unique users active this month | Monthly reach |
| **DAU/MAU Ratio** | DAU / MAU | "Stickiness" — how often monthly users come back daily. 20%+ is good. |
| **ARPU** | Revenue / Total Users | Average revenue per user (including non-payers) |
| **ARPPU** | Revenue / Paying Users | Average revenue per paying user |
| **LTV** | ARPU x Average Lifespan | Lifetime value — what a user is worth over their entire relationship |
| **ROAS** | Revenue from Ad Users / Ad Spend | Return on ad spend — $2 means you got $2 back for every $1 spent |
| **Payback Period** | CAC / Monthly ARPU | How many months to recoup acquisition cost |

---

## Cohort Analysis: The Most Important Analysis

A **cohort** is a group of users who installed your app during the same time period (usually the same week). Cohort analysis tracks how these groups behave over time.

### Why Cohorts Matter

Aggregate metrics hide important trends. If your overall DAU is flat, it might mean:
- Scenario A: New users stick around, old users leave at the same rate (healthy growth)
- Scenario B: Each new cohort retains worse than the last (declining product quality)

Only cohort analysis reveals which scenario is true.

### How to Read a Retention Cohort Table

| Install Week | Day 1 | Day 7 | Day 14 | Day 30 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Week 1 (Jan 1-7)** | 45% | 22% | 15% | 10% |
| **Week 2 (Jan 8-14)** | 43% | 20% | 14% | 9% |
| **Week 3 (Jan 15-21)** | 48% | 25% | 18% | 12% |
| **Week 4 (Jan 22-28)** | 50% | 27% | 19% | 13% |

**Reading this table**:
- Week 1 cohort: 45% came back on Day 1, but only 10% were still active on Day 30
- Week 3 and 4 are **improving** — higher retention across all time periods
- Something changed between Week 2 and Week 3 that made the product stickier (new feature? better onboarding? different ad creative attracting better users?)

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: Run cohort analysis by **acquisition source**. Users from Apple Search Ads (high intent) typically retain 20-40% better than users from display ads (low intent). If your overall retention looks bad, it might be because one source is dragging down the average. Cohorts by source reveal this.
</Tip>

## ROAS Calculation: Are Your Ads Profitable?

ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) is the ultimate metric for advertising effectiveness.

### Simple ROAS

```
ROAS = Revenue from Ad-Acquired Users / Ad Spend

Example:
You spent $5,000 on Meta ads this month.
Users acquired from those ads generated $12,000 in revenue.
ROAS = $12,000 / $5,000 = 2.4x

For every $1 spent, you got $2.40 back.
```

### ROAS by Time Period

ROAS changes over time as users continue to generate revenue:

| Time Period | How to Calculate | Typical Use |
|---|---|---|
| **Day 0 ROAS** | Revenue on install day / Ad spend | Early indicator (very incomplete) |
| **Day 7 ROAS** | Revenue in first 7 days / Ad spend | Quick health check |
| **Day 30 ROAS** | Revenue in first 30 days / Ad spend | Standard evaluation period |
| **Day 90 ROAS** | Revenue in first 90 days / Ad spend | More complete picture |
| **Lifetime ROAS** | Total revenue ever / Ad spend | True ROI (takes months/years) |

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: You will never have perfect ROAS data on Day 1. Use **Day 7 ROAS as a predictor** of long-term performance. If your typical Day 7 ROAS is 30% of your Day 90 ROAS, then a Day 7 ROAS of 0.3x predicts a Day 90 ROAS of 1.0x (breakeven). Build these multipliers from your own historical data to make faster decisions.
</Tip>

### ROAS Targets

| ROAS | Assessment | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Below 0.5x** | Losing significant money | Pause or restructure campaigns |
| **0.5x - 1.0x** | Losing money but might recover over time | Evaluate Day 30+ trends |
| **1.0x - 1.5x** | Near breakeven | Optimize creatives and targeting |
| **1.5x - 3.0x** | Profitable | Scale gradually |
| **Above 3.0x** | Very profitable | Scale aggressively |

## GA4 Setup (For Web + App)

If you have both a website and an app, Google Analytics 4 (GA4) provides a unified view across both platforms.

### Key Differences from Firebase Analytics

| Feature | Firebase Analytics | GA4 |
|---|---|---|
| **Platform** | Mobile apps | Web + Apps |
| **Data model** | Events + parameters | Same (events + parameters) |
| **Reporting** | Firebase Console | GA4 interface (more powerful) |
| **Integration** | Google Ads directly | Google Ads + Search Console + more |
| **Cost** | Free | Free (paid BigQuery export for large volumes) |

Firebase Analytics data automatically feeds into GA4 when you link the projects. You get app analytics in Firebase AND web+app analytics in GA4.

## Data-Driven Decision Framework

Analytics only matters if it drives action. Here is a framework for making decisions based on data:

### Daily Checks (5 minutes)

| What to Check | What to Look For | Action If Abnormal |
|---|---|---|
| Daily installs | Significant drop or spike | Check campaign status, budget, or ASO ranking changes |
| CPI by platform | Sudden increase | Check creative fatigue, competition changes |
| Revenue | Unusual dip | Check app functionality (is something broken?) |

### Weekly Reviews (30 minutes)

| What to Review | Questions to Answer | Typical Actions |
|---|---|---|
| Campaign performance | Which campaigns hit targets? Which did not? | Scale winners, pause losers |
| Creative performance | Which ads have the best CTR and CPI? | Kill fatigued creatives, make new ones |
| Retention by cohort | Is retention improving or declining? | Investigate product changes that affect retention |
| ROAS by platform | Which platforms are most profitable? | Shift budget toward best ROAS |

### Monthly Deep Dives (2-4 hours)

| What to Analyze | Goal | Output |
|---|---|---|
| LTV by acquisition source | Understand user quality by source | Adjust platform allocation |
| Cohort retention curves | Identify retention inflection points | Product improvements |
| Funnel conversion rates | Find biggest drop-off points | Onboarding and UX improvements |
| Budget vs. results | Overall ROI of marketing | Next month's budget plan |

## Common Analytics Mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tracking too many events">
    More events does not mean more insights. Track 10-15 events maximum at the start. Too many events create noise and make analysis harder. Focus on the events that directly relate to your business goals.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Looking at aggregate metrics only">
    "Average CPI" across all platforms hides the fact that Platform A has $2 CPI and Platform B has $8 CPI. Always segment your data by platform, campaign, country, and time period.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Making decisions too quickly">
    A single day's data is unreliable. Wait for at least a week and 50+ conversions before drawing conclusions. Small sample sizes lead to wrong decisions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Ignoring retention">
    Many teams obsess over acquisition metrics (CPI, installs) while ignoring retention. A $1 CPI is meaningless if 95% of users never come back. Track retention as carefully as you track acquisition.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Not connecting ad data to product data">
    Your ad platform tells you CPI. Your product analytics tells you retention and revenue. If these live in separate dashboards that nobody compares, you are missing the most important insight: **which ad campaigns drive the most valuable long-term users?**
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start with Firebase Analytics**: Free, powerful, integrates with Google Ads
2. **Track 10-15 events maximum**: Focus on events that relate to your business goals
3. **Build a dashboard**: Acquisition, activation, engagement, retention, revenue — updated daily
4. **Use cohort analysis**: The single most important analytical technique for understanding user quality
5. **Calculate ROAS**: The ultimate metric for ad campaign effectiveness
6. **Segment everything**: By platform, campaign, country, and time period
7. **Make it actionable**: Analytics that does not drive decisions is a waste of time

<Tip>
**Final thought**: You do not need to be a data scientist to use analytics effectively. You need to ask the right questions ("Which campaigns drive users who actually pay?"), look at the right metrics (ROAS, retention, LTV by source), and act on what you find (scale winners, kill losers, improve the product). Start simple, add complexity as you grow, and always connect ad performance to business outcomes.
