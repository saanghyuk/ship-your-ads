# Vibe Coder Quick Start

You built an app. It works. It is on the App Store and/or Google Play. Now you need users. This guide gets you from zero to running your first paid ad campaign in **60 minutes or less**.

No marketing jargon. No theory. Just step-by-step instructions with exact settings and code.

<Tip>
**Who this is for**: Developers and indie hackers who built an app (especially React Native) and want to start getting real users through advertising. Zero marketing experience required. We will explain everything as we go.
</Tip>

## The 60-Minute Plan

| Minute | Task |
|---|---|
| 0-10 | Create a Meta (Facebook) Business account |
| 10-20 | Install the Meta SDK in your React Native app |
| 20-30 | Set up your Meta Pixel (if you have a website) |
| 30-45 | Create your first campaign |
| 45-55 | Create your ad creative |
| 55-60 | Review, launch, and set up monitoring |

## Why Meta First?

We are starting with Meta (Facebook/Instagram) because:

1. **Lowest minimum budget**: $1/day (vs. $50/day on TikTok)
2. **Largest audience**: 3+ billion users across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger
3. **Best algorithm**: Meta's Advantage+ is arguably the best optimization algorithm in advertising
4. **Easiest to learn**: The most documentation, tutorials, and community support

You can add TikTok, Google, and Apple Search Ads later. Start with one platform and learn it well.

## Step 1: Create Your Meta Business Account (10 minutes)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to business.facebook.com">
    Navigate to [business.facebook.com](https://business.facebook.com) and click **"Create Account"**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign in with your Facebook account">
    Use your personal Facebook account. You need one to create a business account, but your personal info stays separate from your ads.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your business details">
    - **Business name**: Your app name or company name
    - **Your name**: Your real name
    - **Business email**: Your email
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an Ad Account">
    In Business Manager, go to **Business Settings > Accounts > Ad Accounts > Add > Create a New Ad Account**.

    Set your currency and time zone. These cannot be changed later.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a payment method">
    Go to **Business Settings > Payments** and add a credit card. Meta charges when your balance reaches a threshold (usually $25 to start).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Install Meta SDK in Your React Native App (10 minutes)

The SDK lets Meta track installs and in-app events so the algorithm can optimize your campaigns.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the package">
    ```bash
    npm install react-native-fbsdk-next
    # or
    yarn add react-native-fbsdk-next
    ```

    For iOS, also run:
    ```bash
    cd ios && pod install && cd ..
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure for iOS">
    Open `ios/YourApp/Info.plist` and add:

    ```xml
    <key>FacebookAppID</key>
    <string>YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_ID</string>
    <key>FacebookClientToken</key>
    <string>YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN</string>
    <key>FacebookDisplayName</key>
    <string>Your App Name</string>
    <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
    <array>
      <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
          <string>fbYOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_ID</string>
        </array>
      </dict>
    </array>
    ```

    Get your App ID and Client Token from [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com) > Your App > Settings > Basic.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure for Android">
    Open `android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` and add:

    ```xml
    <string name="facebook_app_id">YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_ID</string>
    <string name="facebook_client_token">YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN</string>
    ```

    Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add inside `<application>`:

    ```xml
    <meta-data
      android:name="com.facebook.sdk.ApplicationId"
      android:value="@string/facebook_app_id"/>
    <meta-data
      android:name="com.facebook.sdk.ClientToken"
      android:value="@string/facebook_client_token"/>
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize in your app">
    ```typescript
    // App.tsx or index.js
    import { Settings } from 'react-native-fbsdk-next';

    // Initialize at app startup
    Settings.initializeSDK();

    // Optional: Enable advertiser tracking (needed for iOS 14+)
    Settings.setAdvertiserTrackingEnabled(true);
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Track key events">
    ```typescript
    import { AppEventsLogger } from 'react-native-fbsdk-next';

    // Track when user completes registration
    AppEventsLogger.logEvent('fb_mobile_complete_registration');

    // Track when user makes a purchase
    AppEventsLogger.logPurchase(9.99, 'USD');

    // Track a custom event
    AppEventsLogger.logEvent('level_complete', { level: 5 });

    // Track when user starts a trial
    AppEventsLogger.logEvent('StartTrial', {
      fb_currency: 'USD',
      fb_content_id: 'premium_monthly',
    });
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement App Tracking Transparency (iOS)">
    iOS requires you to ask permission before tracking. Install the ATT package:

    ```bash
    npm install react-native-tracking-transparency
    ```

    ```typescript
    import {
      requestTrackingPermission,
      getTrackingStatus,
    } from 'react-native-tracking-transparency';

    // Call this at app startup (before any tracking)
    async function requestTracking() {
      const status = await requestTrackingPermission();
      console.log('Tracking status:', status);
      // 'authorized', 'denied', 'not-determined', 'restricted'
    }
    ```

    Add to `Info.plist`:
    ```xml
    <key>NSUserTrackingUsageDescription</key>
    <string>This helps us show you relevant ads and improve your experience.</string>
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: The ATT prompt message matters. Keep it simple and explain the benefit to the user. Something like "This helps us show you relevant ads and improve your experience" is better than a long technical explanation. You cannot customize the prompt itself (Apple controls that), but you can customize the description text.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Create Your First Campaign (15 minutes)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Meta Ads Manager">
    Navigate to [adsmanager.facebook.com](https://adsmanager.facebook.com) and click **"+ Create"**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your objective">
    Select **"App promotion"** (formerly App Installs). This tells Meta to optimize for getting people to install your app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your app">
    Choose your app from the dropdown. If it does not appear, add it first in your Meta Business Settings under Apps.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Advantage+ App Campaigns">
    Meta offers **Advantage+ App Campaigns** which automate most settings. For your first campaign, use this. It is the easiest option and performs well.

    If you want manual control, select "Manual App Campaigns" instead — but Advantage+ is recommended for beginners.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set your budget">
    Start with **$20/day**. This is enough to gather data while being affordable. You can increase later.

    At $20/day, expect roughly 5-20 installs per day depending on your category and creative quality.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set your targeting (if manual)">
    If using manual campaigns:
    - **Countries**: Your primary market (e.g., United States)
    - **Age**: 18-44 (or adjust for your app)
    - **Everything else**: Leave broad. Meta's algorithm will find your best users.

    If using Advantage+, targeting is largely automatic.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose optimization event">
    Optimize for **App Installs** to start. Once you have enough installs (50+ per week), you can switch to optimizing for in-app events (purchase, subscription) for better quality users.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Create Your Ad Creative (10 minutes)

You need a video or image ad. Here is the fastest way to create one:

### Option A: Simple Screen Recording (5 minutes)

1. Open your app on your phone
2. Start a screen recording (built into iOS and Android)
3. Walk through the key features of your app — show the value
4. Stop recording
5. Add text overlays using any free video editor (CapCut, InShot, or Meta's built-in tools)
6. Keep it under 30 seconds

### Option B: Static Image with Text (2 minutes)

1. Take a screenshot of your app showing its best feature
2. Add a compelling headline using Canva (free) or any image editor
3. Upload to Meta

### Option C: Use Meta's Built-In Creative Tools (5 minutes)

Meta Ads Manager has built-in video creation tools that let you turn images and screenshots into simple animated videos. Use these if you do not want to shoot video.

### What to Include in Your Ad

| Element | What to Do |
|---|---|
| **Headline** | One clear benefit: "Track your sleep in 30 seconds" |
| **Primary text** | 1-2 sentences expanding on the benefit |
| **Creative** | Show the app in use — not just a logo or icon |
| **CTA button** | "Install Now" or "Download" |

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: Your first ad does not need to be perfect. It needs to be **live**. A mediocre ad running is infinitely better than a perfect ad that never launches. Get something out there, learn from the data, and improve in version 2.
</Tip>

---

## Step 5: Launch and Monitor (5 minutes)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review everything">
    Double-check: correct app, correct budget, ad creative looks good on mobile.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Publish">
    Submit your campaign. Meta reviews ads (usually takes a few minutes to a few hours). You will get a notification when it is approved.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set a calendar reminder for Day 7">
    Do NOT touch anything for 7 days. The algorithm needs this time to learn. Set a reminder to check results on Day 7.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## The 7-Day Waiting Period

This is the hardest part. You will be tempted to check your dashboard every hour, panic when you see zero installs at 9am, and want to change everything on Day 2. **Do not.**

### What Is Happening During These 7 Days

| Day | What Meta Is Doing |
|---|---|
| **Day 1-2** | Exploring — showing your ad to different people to learn who responds |
| **Day 3-4** | Learning — identifying patterns in who installs and who does not |
| **Day 5-7** | Optimizing — focusing spend on the people most likely to install |

### What You Should Do

- Check results **once per day** maximum, not every hour
- Do not change the budget
- Do not change the creative
- Do not change the targeting
- Do not panic if Day 1 CPI is high — it always is during the learning phase

---

## Day 7: Decision Time

After 7 days, pull your data and evaluate:

### Scenario A: It Is Working

**Signals**: CPI is below your target, installs are flowing, users are engaging with your app.

**Action**:
1. Increase budget by 20% (e.g., $20/day to $24/day)
2. Create 2-3 new ad variations to test
3. Wait another 5-7 days
4. Repeat

### Scenario B: Mixed Results

**Signals**: Some days are good, some are bad. CPI is close to your target but inconsistent.

**Action**:
1. Keep the campaign running for 7 more days for more data
2. Create 2-3 new ad creatives (the creative is probably the issue)
3. Check your App Store / Play Store listing — is it compelling enough?

### Scenario C: It Is Not Working

**Signals**: CPI is 2x+ your target, very few installs, low CTR (under 0.5%).

**Action**:
1. The creative is probably the problem. Create completely different ads.
2. Check your targeting — is your audience relevant?
3. Check your App Store listing — bad screenshots or low ratings kill conversion rates
4. Try a different campaign objective or approach
5. Do NOT just increase budget on a losing campaign

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: In 90% of cases when a campaign is not working, the problem is the **creative**. Not the targeting, not the budget, not the platform. Create new ads that are fundamentally different (new angle, new format, new hook) and test again.
</Tip>

---

## What to Do After Your First Campaign

Once you have a working campaign on Meta, here is your growth path:

| Timeframe | Action |
|---|---|
| **Week 2-4** | Test 3-5 new ad creatives. Kill losers, scale winners. |
| **Month 2** | Add a second platform: Apple Search Ads (for iOS) or Google App Campaigns |
| **Month 3** | Add retargeting campaigns on Meta |
| **Month 4** | Consider TikTok if your budget supports $50/day minimum |
| **Ongoing** | Continuously test new creatives (the most important ongoing activity) |

---

## Quick Reference: The Exact Settings

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| **Platform** | Meta (Facebook/Instagram) |
| **Objective** | App Promotion (App Installs) |
| **Campaign type** | Advantage+ App Campaigns |
| **Daily budget** | $20/day to start |
| **Targeting** | Broad (primary country, age 18-44) |
| **Optimization** | App Installs |
| **Creative** | Video (screen recording) or image, under 30 seconds |
| **CTA** | Install Now |
| **Wait time** | 7 days before making changes |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start with Meta**: Lowest budget minimum, best algorithm, most beginner-friendly
2. **Install the SDK**: Without it, Meta cannot optimize your campaigns
3. **Keep your first ad simple**: A screen recording with text overlays is good enough
4. **Wait 7 days**: The algorithm needs time to learn. Do not touch anything.
5. **Creative is 80% of success**: If something is not working, make new ads
6. **Scale gradually**: +20% budget every 2-3 days once you have a winner
7. **Add platforms over time**: Apple Search Ads, then Google, then TikTok

<Tip>
**Final encouragement**: You are a developer. You build things for a living. Advertising is just another system to learn — it has inputs (budget, creative, targeting), processing (the algorithm), and outputs (installs, revenue). You already have the analytical mindset to succeed. Your first campaign will not be perfect, and that is fine. What matters is that you launch, learn, and iterate. Just like shipping code.
</Tip>
