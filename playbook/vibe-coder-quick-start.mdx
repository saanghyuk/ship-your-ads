## You build apps. Now let's get users.

You're a developer. You don't need a 200-page marketing textbook. You need to know what to do, in what order, and how not to waste money. This page is your cheat sheet.

## What you'll learn

- The fastest path from zero to running ads
- Which platform to pick (just one, for now)
- Exact steps to set up and launch
- How much to spend and what to expect
- The metrics that matter and what to ignore

## The 30-second version

```
1. Pick Meta Ads (unless your app is iOS-only, then Apple Search Ads)
2. Install the tracking SDK
3. Create a campaign with $15/day budget
4. Make 3-5 ad variations
5. Wait 7 days
6. Look at the data, kill losers, scale winners
7. Repeat
```

That's it. Everything else is optimization.

## Step-by-step speed run

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pick your platform (5 minutes)">
    | Your situation | Pick this |
    |---------------|-----------|
    | Any app, any platform | **Meta Ads** |
    | iOS-only, people would search for it | **Apple Search Ads** |
    | People Google your problem | **Google Ads** |
    | Young audience, visual app | **TikTok Ads** |

    **Don't overthink it.** Meta is the safe default for 90% of apps.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up your account (15 minutes)">
    Create your ad account on your chosen platform. See our platform-specific setup guides for details. The key: use real business info, set a spending limit, and enable 2FA.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install tracking (30-60 minutes)">
    This is the most technical step, and it's worth doing right.

    **Meta:** Install the Meta SDK via SPM (iOS) or Gradle (Android)

    **Google:** Install Firebase SDK

    **Apple:** No SDK needed (tracking is automatic)

    **TikTok:** Install TikTok SDK or connect your MMP

    See our [SDK Integration Guide](/playbook/sdk-integration) for copy-paste code snippets.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your first campaign (30 minutes)">
    Use these settings:

    ```
    Objective:    App Installs
    Budget:       $15/day
    Audience:     Broad (your country, ages 18-65)
    Placements:   Automatic
    Creative:     3-5 variations (images or short videos)
    Duration:     Let it run for 7+ days
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait 7 days (hardest step)">
    Seriously, don't touch it. The algorithm needs time to learn. Check your stats once a day, but change nothing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Read the data and iterate">
    After 7 days, check:
    - **CPI (Cost Per Install):** Is it below your target? (Don't know your target? $3-5 is a reasonable starting point.)
    - **Which ads are winning?** Pause the losers, make more creative like the winners.
    - **Are installs being tracked?** If zero installs show in your dashboard, your tracking is broken — fix it first.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The numbers you need to know

| Metric | What it means | What's "good" |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **CPI** | Cost per install | $1-5 (varies by category) |
| **CTR** | % who click your ad | 1-3% (Meta), 5-15% (Apple) |
| **ROAS** | Revenue / ad spend | Above 1.0 = profitable |

Ignore everything else for now. Impressions, reach, frequency — they're useful later, but not yet.

## Common developer mistakes

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Building first, marketing later" icon="code">
    Start learning ads before your app is "perfect." You can set up accounts, test creative, and build audiences while still developing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Over-engineering tracking" icon="gears">
    You don't need to track 50 events on day one. Track installs and one key action (sign-up or purchase). Add more events later.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Targeting too narrowly" icon="crosshairs">
    Your instinct as a developer is to be precise. With ads, start broad and let the algorithm find your users. It's better at this than you are.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Giving up after a week" icon="flag">
    Your first campaign probably won't be profitable. That's normal. The data you get from it is what makes your second campaign better.

## Quick reference: platform comparison

| | Meta | Google | Apple | TikTok |
|--|------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Min budget** | $5/day | $10/day | $5/day | $20/day |
| **Setup time** | 1-2 hours | 1-2 hours | 30 min | 1-2 hours |
| **Best for** | Any app | Searchable problems | iOS apps | Young audience |
| **Creative** | Image/video | Text/image | App Store page | Video (native) |
| **Difficulty** | Medium | Medium-High | Low | Medium |

<Tip>
  **Developer advantage:** You can install tracking SDKs yourself, build custom landing pages, set up analytics, and automate reporting. Most non-technical marketers have to hire someone for all of that. Use your technical skills as a competitive edge.
