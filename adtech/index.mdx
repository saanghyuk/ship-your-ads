# Ad Tech Deep Dive

Welcome to the deep end of the pool. This section is for developers who aren't satisfied with just *using* ad tech -- you want to understand how the entire system works under the hood.

<Note>
This section is supplementary reading. You don't need any of this to use Ship Your Ads effectively. But if you're the kind of developer who reads RFCs for fun, you're in the right place.
</Note>

## What is Ad Tech?

**Ad Tech** (advertising technology) is the collective infrastructure -- servers, protocols, algorithms, and data pipelines -- that enables digital advertising at scale. Think of it as the "cloud infrastructure" of the advertising world.

If you've ever wondered:
- How does an ad appear on a webpage in under 100 milliseconds?
- Why does that shoe ad follow you across the internet?
- How do advertisers know their ads actually worked?
- Why is Google facing antitrust lawsuits over ad tech?

...then this section has your answers.

<Tip>
**Software engineering analogy**: Ad tech is essentially a massive distributed system for matching supply (publisher ad space) with demand (advertiser budgets), with real-time auctions, complex attribution pipelines, and fraud detection -- all operating at millions of requests per second.

## A Brief History of Advertising

Advertising is one of the oldest professions. Here's the speed run:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ancient Times (~3000 BC)">
    The earliest known advertisement was found on an Egyptian papyrus -- a notice for a runaway slave. Romans painted walls with political campaign messages. The concept is timeless: **someone has something to say, and they'll pay to reach an audience**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Print Era (1440s - 1900s)">
    Gutenberg's printing press enabled the first mass advertising. Newspapers started carrying ads in the 1600s. By the 1800s, ad agencies emerged to broker deals between advertisers and newspapers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Broadcast Era (1920s - 1990s)">
    Radio and television transformed advertising into a mass medium. The "Mad Men" era of the 1960s established modern brand advertising. A 30-second Super Bowl spot became the pinnacle of advertising reach.
  </Step>
  <Step title="The Internet Changes Everything (1994 - Present)">
    On **October 27, 1994**, the first banner ad appeared on HotWired.com. AT&T paid for a 468x60 pixel banner that read "Have you ever clicked your mouse right HERE? You will." It achieved a **44% click-through rate** -- a number that would make any modern advertiser weep with joy (today's average display CTR is about 0.1%).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How the Internet Changed Advertising Forever

The internet didn't just add a new channel for advertising -- it fundamentally rewrote the rules:

| Before Internet | After Internet |
|---|---|
| Buy ad space in bulk, hope the right people see it | Target specific users based on behavior and context |
| Wait weeks/months to measure results | Measure impressions, clicks, conversions in real-time |
| Fixed pricing negotiated by humans | Automated auctions in milliseconds |
| One creative shown to everyone | Dynamic creative optimized per user |
| Attribution is guesswork | Multi-touch attribution across channels |
| Buying requires phone calls and faxes | Programmatic buying via APIs |

<Accordion title="For the curious: Why digital advertising is a $600B+ market">
Digital advertising surpassed traditional advertising in global spend around 2019. By 2024, global digital ad spend exceeded **$600 billion**. The reasons are straightforward:

1. **Measurability**: Unlike a billboard, you can measure exactly how many people saw your digital ad, clicked on it, and ultimately purchased something.
2. **Targeting precision**: Instead of showing a car ad to everyone watching a TV show, you can show it only to people who recently searched for "best SUV 2024."
3. **Programmatic efficiency**: Machines can evaluate billions of ad opportunities per day and make optimal buying decisions.
4. **Lower barrier to entry**: A small business can start advertising on Google with $10/day. Try buying a Super Bowl spot with that budget.

The market is dominated by a few players: **Google** (~28% of global digital ad revenue), **Meta** (~20%), **Amazon** (~7%), with the rest split among thousands of smaller platforms.

## Who This Section Is For

This deep dive is written for:

- **Developers** who work with ad tech APIs and want to understand the bigger picture
- **Product managers** building features that touch advertising
- **Data engineers** working with attribution and measurement data
- **Curious technologists** who want to understand one of the internet's largest distributed systems

We assume you're comfortable with concepts like APIs, distributed systems, databases, and basic web architecture. We'll use software engineering analogies throughout to make ad tech concepts click.
