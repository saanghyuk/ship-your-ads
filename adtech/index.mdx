# Ad Tech Deep Dive

Welcome to the Ad Tech Deep Dive — a comprehensive guide to how digital advertising actually works behind the scenes. If you have ever wondered what happens in the milliseconds between a webpage loading and an ad appearing, or how companies like Google and Meta make billions from showing ads, this section is for you.

The digital advertising industry generates over **$600 billion per year** globally. It is the economic engine that funds most of the free internet — search engines, social media, news sites, mobile apps, and streaming services. Understanding how it works is not just academically interesting — it is practical knowledge that makes you a better marketer, developer, and business person.

<Tip>
**Who is this for?** This section is written for curious beginners, developers, and marketers who want to understand the technology behind advertising. We use analogies from software engineering to make complex concepts accessible, but no technical background is required. If you can follow a conversation about how websites work, you can follow this.

| **2015** | Header bidding invented | Publishers fight back against Google's ad server monopoly |
| **2018** | GDPR takes effect | Privacy regulation begins reshaping the entire industry |
| **2021** | iOS 14.5 (ATT) | Apple's privacy changes cost Meta $10B+ and fundamentally change mobile advertising |
