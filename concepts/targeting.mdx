## What is targeting?

Targeting means telling the ad platform: **"Show my ad to people like THIS."**

It's the difference between:
- Shouting in a crowded mall: "HEY EVERYONE, DOWNLOAD MY APP!" ❌
- Tapping someone on the shoulder: "Hey, I noticed you're into fitness. Want a free workout tracker?" ✅

## The 5 types of targeting

### 1. Demographic targeting

The basics: who are they?

| Parameter | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| Age | 18-24, 25-34, 35-44 |
| Gender | All, Male, Female |
| Location | Country, State, City, Radius |
| Language | English, Korean, Spanish |

<Tip>
  **Start with location + age only.** Don't over-narrow demographics on your first campaign.
  Let the platform's algorithm figure out who responds best.
</Tip>

### 2. Interest-based targeting

What do they like? What pages do they follow? What apps do they use?

**Examples:**
- "Fitness" → people who engage with fitness content
- "Cooking" → people who watch recipe videos
- "Technology" → people who follow tech news

<Note>
  Interest targeting is a **suggestion**, not a guarantee.
  "Interested in fitness" might include someone who liked one gym post 6 months ago.
  That's okay — the algorithm gets smarter with more data.
</Note>

### 3. Behavioral targeting

What have they actually done?

- Recently purchased a new phone
- Traveled internationally in the last month
- Engaged with apps similar to yours
- Frequent online shoppers

This is more precise than interests because it's based on **actions**, not just likes.

### 4. Keyword targeting (Google & Apple)

What are they searching for right now?

```
User types: "best meditation app"
Your ad appears at the top of the search results.
```

This is the most powerful targeting because the user is **actively looking for something**. They have intent.

<Tip>
  **This is why Apple Search Ads and Google Search Ads convert so well.**
  The user is literally telling you what they want.
</Tip>

### 5. Custom & Lookalike audiences

This is where it gets magical (once you have some data):

**Custom Audience:** Upload a list of your existing users → the platform shows ads to them (great for re-engagement).

**Lookalike Audience:** Give the platform your best users → it finds **new people who look like them**.

```
Your best 100 users → Platform analyzes their traits → Finds 1M similar people → Shows your ad to them
```

<Warning>
  You need **at least 100 users** (ideally 1,000+) before lookalike audiences work well.
  Don't worry about this for your first campaign. Come back to it later.
</Warning>

  <Step title="Let the algorithm learn">
    Modern ad platforms (especially Meta) are incredibly good at finding the right people.
    Give them room to work. Don't over-restrict.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Look at the data after 3-5 days">
    Who's clicking? Who's installing? What age group? What placement?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Narrow based on data">
    Now you can make informed decisions about who to target more (or less).
  </Step>

## Common beginner mistakes

| Mistake | Why it's bad | What to do instead |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Targeting too narrow | Not enough people to show ads to | Start broad, narrow later |
| Targeting too many interests at once | Confusing signal for the algorithm | Pick 2-3 related interests |
| Only targeting your own demographic | Your users might surprise you | Let data guide you |
| Ignoring location | Paying for users who can't use your app | Always set relevant locations |
