## The Russian doll of ads

Every major ad platform organizes ads in **3 levels**, like Russian nesting dolls:

```
📦 Campaign        ← The big picture (goal + budget)
  📁 Ad Set        ← Who sees it (targeting + schedule)
    📄 Ad          ← What they see (creative + text)
```

<Note>
  Different platforms use different names, but the structure is always the same:

  | Level | Meta | Google | TikTok | Apple |
  |-------|------|--------|--------|-------|
  | Level 1 | Campaign | Campaign | Campaign | Campaign |
  | Level 2 | Ad Set | Ad Group | Ad Group | Ad Group |
  | Level 3 | Ad | Ad | Ad | Ad (keyword) |
</Note>

## Level 1: Campaign — "What's the goal?"

The campaign is where you decide:
- **What do I want?** (installs, website visits, awareness)
- **How much am I willing to spend total?** (optional campaign budget)

Think of it as: "I want more app installs and I have $500 to spend this month."

### Common campaign objectives

| Objective | When to use it | You pay for |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **App Installs** | You want downloads | Each install |
| **Traffic** | You want website/landing page visits | Each click |
| **Conversions** | You want specific in-app actions | Each conversion |
| **Awareness** | You want people to know about you | Impressions (views) |

<Tip>
  **For your first campaign, always pick "App Installs."** It's the simplest and most directly useful goal.
</Tip>

## Level 2: Ad Set — "Who should see this?"

The ad set is where you get specific about your audience:

- **Who:** Age, gender, location, interests, behaviors
- **Where:** Instagram feed, Facebook stories, Google search, etc.
- **When:** Start date, end date, time of day
- **How much:** Daily budget for this specific group

### Example ad set setup:

```
Ad Set: "Young Fitness Enthusiasts"
  - Age: 18-30
  - Location: United States
  - Interests: Fitness, Running, Gym
  - Placements: Instagram Feed + Stories
  - Daily budget: $10
```

<Warning>
  A common beginner mistake: making your audience **too narrow**.
  If you target "25-year-old women in Brooklyn who like yoga AND matcha AND own a dog" — your audience is like 47 people.
  Start broad, then narrow down based on data.
</Warning>

## Level 3: Ad — "What do they see?"

The ad is the actual creative content users see:

- **Image or video** (the visual)
- **Primary text** (the main message)
- **Headline** (the bold text)
- **Call to action** (the button: "Install Now", "Learn More", etc.)

### What makes a good ad (the basics):

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="✅ Do" icon="check">
    - Show the app in action
    - Address a pain point
    - Keep text short
    - Use a clear CTA
    - Test multiple versions
  </Card>
  <Card title="❌ Don't" icon="x">
    - Use generic stock photos
    - Write an essay
    - Make false promises
    - Use only one ad forever
    - Ignore the platform's ad specs
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## The golden rule: test at the right level

```
Want to test different audiences?  → Make multiple Ad Sets
Want to test different creatives?  → Make multiple Ads within one Ad Set
Want to test different goals?      → Make multiple Campaigns
```

This structure keeps things organized and lets you pinpoint exactly what's working.
