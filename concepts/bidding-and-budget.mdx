## The two money questions

When running ads, you need to answer two questions:

1. **Budget:** How much total do I want to spend per day?
2. **Bid:** How much am I willing to pay for one result (click, install, etc.)?

## Budget: Start small, learn fast

<Warning>
  **Do NOT blow $1,000 on your first campaign.** Seriously.
  Your first campaign is for **learning**, not scaling.
</Warning>

### Recommended starting budgets

| Platform | Minimum daily | Our recommendation | Learning period |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Meta | $1/day | **$10-20/day** | 3-7 days |
| Google Ads | $1/day | **$15-25/day** | 5-10 days |
| Apple Search Ads | $0.50/day | **$10-15/day** | 3-7 days |
| TikTok | $20/day | **$20-30/day** | 5-7 days |

<Tip>
  **The magic number: ~$100-200 for your first test.**
  Run $15/day for 7-10 days. You'll get enough data to know if your ad works.
</Tip>

### Daily budget vs. Lifetime budget

| Type | How it works | Best for |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Daily budget** | Spends up to $X every day | Ongoing campaigns, beginners |
| **Lifetime budget** | Spends up to $X total over a period | Fixed promotions, events |

**Start with daily budget.** It's simpler and you can pause anytime.

## Bidding: How the auction works for your wallet

Remember the auction from [How Ads Work](/how-ads-work)? Here's the money side:

### Bidding strategies

| Strategy | You tell the platform... | Best for |
|----------|------------------------|----------|
| **Lowest cost** (auto) | "Get me the most results within my budget" | Beginners ✅ |
| **Cost cap** | "Get me results, but don't pay more than $X each" | After you know your target CPI |
| **Bid cap** | "Never bid more than $X in the auction" | Advanced optimization |

<Note>
  **For your first campaign, always use "Lowest cost" (automatic bidding).**
  Let the platform figure out the right bid. You can get fancy later.
</Note>

## The learning phase — don't panic

When you launch a campaign, the platform enters a **learning phase**:

```
Day 1-3: "I'm figuring out who responds to your ad..."
  → Results might be expensive and inconsistent

Day 3-7: "I'm getting better at finding the right people..."
  → Costs start to stabilize

Day 7+: "I know your audience now."
  → Consistent, optimized results
```

<Warning>
  **The #1 mistake beginners make:** Seeing bad results on Day 1 and immediately pausing the campaign.
  Give it at **least 3-5 days** and **50 conversion events** before judging.
  The algorithm needs data to learn. You need patience.
</Warning>

## What does it actually cost?

Real-world benchmarks (these vary by category, country, and creative quality):

| Metric | Low end | Average | High end |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| **CPC** (cost per click) | $0.20 | $0.50-1.00 | $3.00+ |
| **CPI** (cost per install) | $0.50 | $1.50-3.00 | $10.00+ |
| **CPM** (cost per 1,000 views) | $2.00 | $5.00-10.00 | $30.00+ |

<Tip>
  If your CPI is under $2-3 for a consumer app, you're doing great.
  If it's over $5, your creative or targeting probably needs work.
</Tip>

## Budget math: a simple formula

```
Monthly budget = Target installs × CPI

Example:
  Want 500 installs/month?
  Average CPI = $2?
  Monthly budget = 500 × $2 = $1,000/month (~$33/day)
```
