## Why tracking matters

Imagine this: you're running ads on Meta AND Google. You get 100 installs today. But which platform drove them? Which ad? Which audience?

Without tracking, you have **no idea**.

<Warning>
  Running ads without tracking is like driving with your eyes closed.
  You might get somewhere, but you'll probably crash.
</Warning>

## What is attribution?

**Attribution** = figuring out which ad led to which install (or purchase, or sign-up).

```
User sees your Instagram ad
  → Clicks it
    → Goes to App Store
      → Installs your app
        → Opens the app

Attribution connects all these dots:
  "This install came from Instagram Ad #3, targeting fitness enthusiasts"
```

## The two types of tracking

### 1. Platform tracking (Built-in)

Each ad platform has its own tracking tool:

| Platform | Tracking tool | What it does |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Meta | **Meta Pixel** (web) / **SDK** (app) | Tracks actions from Meta ads |
| Google | **Google Conversion Tag** / **Firebase** | Tracks actions from Google ads |
| TikTok | **TikTok Pixel** / **SDK** | Tracks actions from TikTok ads |
| Apple | **Apple Search Ads Attribution API** | Tracks installs from Apple ads |

<Note>
  Each platform only tracks **its own ads**. Meta doesn't know about your Google installs, and vice versa.
</Note>

### 2. Third-party tracking (MMP)

An **MMP** (Mobile Measurement Partner) tracks across ALL platforms in one place.

| MMP | Best for | Pricing |
|-----|----------|---------|
| **AppsFlyer** | Most popular, great docs | Free up to 10K conversions |
| **Adjust** | Strong fraud protection | Paid |
| **Branch** | Deep linking + attribution | Free tier available |
| **Singular** | Cost aggregation + attribution | Paid |

### Do you need an MMP?

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Running ads on **1 platform only** | Platform tracking is enough for now |
| Running ads on **2+ platforms** | You'll want an MMP eventually |
| **Just starting out** | Start with platform tracking, add MMP later |

<Tip>
  **For your first campaign:** Just use the platform's built-in tracking.
  It's free, it works, and it's the fastest way to get started.
  You can add an MMP when you scale to multiple platforms.
</Tip>

## The privacy landscape (important context)

In recent years, privacy changes have made tracking harder:

| Change | Impact | What to know |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **iOS 14.5+ ATT** | Users must opt-in to tracking on iOS | ~25-35% opt-in rate |
| **SKAdNetwork (SKAN)** | Apple's privacy-friendly attribution | Limited data, delayed reporting |
| **Google Privacy Sandbox** | Android's version of ATT (coming) | Still evolving |

<Note>
  **Don't panic about privacy changes.** They make tracking less precise, not impossible.
  Platforms have adapted. You'll still get enough data to optimize your campaigns.
  Just know that reported numbers might be ~20-30% lower than reality on iOS.
</Note>

## What to track (your essential events)

At minimum, set up tracking for these events:

| Event | What it means | Priority |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Install** | User downloads and opens your app | Must have |
| **Registration** | User creates an account | Must have |
| **Key action** | The main thing users do in your app | Must have |
| **Purchase** | User pays for something | If applicable |

<Tip>
  The "key action" depends on your app:
  - Fitness app → Completed a workout
  - Notes app → Created a note
  - Social app → Added a friend
  - E-commerce → Added to cart
</Tip>
