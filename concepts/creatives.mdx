## The creative is 80% of the game

You can have perfect targeting and unlimited budget. But if your ad looks boring, nobody will tap it.

**The creative** = the image, video, and text that users actually see.

<Note>
  Studies consistently show that **creative quality is the #1 factor** in ad performance.
  Not targeting. Not budget. Not bidding strategy. **The creative.**
</Note>

## The anatomy of an ad

Every ad has these parts:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  [Your brand name]          │
│                             │
│  ┌───────────────────────┐  │
│  │                       │  │
│  │    IMAGE or VIDEO     │  │
│  │                       │  │
│  └───────────────────────┘  │
│                             │
│  Primary text: "Your main   │
│  message goes here..."      │
│                             │
│  Headline: Bold hook        │
│  Description: Supporting    │
│                             │
│  [ Install Now ]  ← CTA    │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

## The 3-second rule

Users scroll fast. You have **about 3 seconds** to:

1. **Stop the scroll** — something visual catches their eye
2. **Communicate value** — they understand what your app does
3. **Motivate action** — they want to tap

If you can't do this in 3 seconds, your ad won't work.

## 5 creative formats that work

### 1. App demo video (Best for beginners ✅)

A short screen recording showing your app in action.

```
Format: 15-30 seconds
Structure:
  0-3s: Hook (the problem or a bold statement)
  3-15s: Show the app solving the problem
  15-25s: Key features or benefits
  25-30s: Call to action
```

<Tip>
  **You can record this with your phone's screen recorder.** No fancy tools needed.
  Add captions — 85% of social media videos are watched without sound.
</Tip>

### 2. Before/After

Show life WITHOUT your app vs. WITH your app.

```
Without: Messy spreadsheet tracking expenses
With: Beautiful chart in your finance app
```

### 3. Problem → Solution

Start with a problem your user has, then show how your app solves it.

```
"Tired of forgetting your habits?"
→ Show your habit tracker app
→ "Never miss a day again."
```

### 4. Social proof

If you have users, show their results or reviews.

```
"10,000 people already use [App] to..."
"★★★★★ 'This app changed my morning routine'"
```

### 5. UGC-style (User Generated Content)

A person talking to camera about your app, as if they're recommending it to a friend.

<Note>
  UGC-style ads are **dominating** right now, especially on Meta and TikTok.
  They feel authentic. They don't feel like ads. That's why they work.
</Note>

## The golden rule: Always Be Testing

<Warning>
  **Never run just one ad.** Always run at least 3-5 variations.
  Let the platform figure out which one performs best.
</Warning>

What to test:

| Element | Example variations |
|---------|-------------------|
| Hook (first 3 seconds) | Different opening lines or visuals |
| Visual style | Screen recording vs. lifestyle vs. UGC |
| Text | Different pain points or benefits |
| CTA | "Install Now" vs. "Try Free" vs. "Get Started" |

| Tool | What it does | Cost |

| **Canva** | Image and video ads | Free tier available |
| **CapCut** | Video editing (great for TikTok) | Free |
