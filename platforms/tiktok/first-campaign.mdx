## Make your first TikTok ad

TikTok campaigns follow the same 3-level structure as Meta (Campaign > Ad Group > Ad), so if you've run Meta ads, this will feel familiar. The big difference is the creative — TikTok rewards authentic, entertaining content over polished advertising.

## What you'll learn

- How to create a campaign with the right settings
- How to set up targeting and budgets
- How to create TikTok-native ad creative
- Creative formulas that work for app installs
- What to expect in the first two weeks

## Before you start

Have these ready:

- [ ] TikTok Ads Manager account (approved)
- [ ] Tracking installed and verified
- [ ] At least 1-3 vertical videos (9:16, 15-30 seconds)
- [ ] Ad copy (short and punchy)
- [ ] Budget: $50/day minimum for the campaign

## Step-by-step campaign creation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new campaign">
    In TikTok Ads Manager, click **Create**. Choose **App Promotion** as your advertising objective.

    Set your campaign budget to at least $50/day (TikTok's minimum for campaign-level budgets).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your ad group">
    **App:** Select your app from the dropdown

    **Placements:** Choose **Automatic Placement** (TikTok, Pangle, and partner apps) or restrict to **TikTok only** if you want more control

    **Targeting:**
    - Location: Your primary market
    - Age: 18-35 (or broader if appropriate)
    - Interests: Add relevant categories
    - Leave other targeting broad

    **Budget & Schedule:**
    - Ad group budget: $20/day minimum
    - Schedule: Start immediately, no end date
    - Optimization goal: App Installs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your ad">
    **Upload your video** (vertical 9:16 format)

    **Ad text:** Keep it under 100 characters. Casual, not corporate.

    **CTA button:** "Download" or "Install Now"

    **Identity:** Use a TikTok account if you have one, or use a display name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and submit">
    Double-check all settings. TikTok reviews ads before they go live (usually within an hour).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creative that works on TikTok

This is the most important part. Your creative determines 80%+ of your ad's performance on TikTok.

### The winning formula

```
Hook (0-2 seconds): Grab attention immediately
    → Problem/relatability (2-5 seconds): "Ever feel like..."
        → Solution (5-15 seconds): Show your app solving the problem
            → CTA (last 2 seconds): "Download now" or "Link in bio"
```

### Creative dos and don'ts

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Film vertically (9:16) | Use horizontal video |
| Start with a strong hook in second 1 | Build up slowly |
| Use trending sounds/music | Use silence or corporate music |
| Show the app in action | Just talk about the app |
| Keep it 15-30 seconds | Go over 60 seconds |
| Make 3-5 variations | Launch with just 1 ad |
| Refresh creative every 1-2 weeks | Run the same ad for months |

<Tip>
  **Don't have video production skills?** That's actually fine. Some of the best-performing TikTok ads look like they were shot in 5 minutes on a phone — because they were. Authenticity beats production quality on this platform every time.
</Tip>

## Recommended first campaign settings

| Setting | Recommendation |
|---------|---------------|
| **Objective** | App Promotion |
| **Campaign budget** | $50/day |
| **Ad group budget** | $20-25/day per ad group |
| **Targeting** | Broad (1 country, age 18-35) |
| **Placements** | TikTok only (start focused) |
| **Bidding** | Lowest cost (let TikTok optimize) |
| **Number of ads** | 3-5 video variations |
| **Video length** | 15-30 seconds |

<Warning>
  **TikTok has a higher minimum budget than other platforms.** $20/day per ad group is the minimum, and $50/day per campaign. If your total budget is under $500/month, consider starting with Meta or Apple Search Ads first, then adding TikTok when you can afford to give it enough budget.
</Warning>

## What to expect

| Time | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| **Day 1** | Ad in review (usually approved within hours) |
| **Day 1-3** | Learning phase — TikTok tests different users and placements |
| **Day 4-7** | Results start to stabilize. Check which creative is winning. |
| **Week 2** | Pause underperforming ads. Scale winners by 20%. Start new creative tests. |
| **Week 3+** | You'll know your baseline CPI and which creative styles work. |

## Quick optimization tips

- **Kill losers fast** — if an ad has 1,000+ impressions and zero installs, pause it
- **Scale winners slowly** — increase budget by 20% every 3 days
- **Refresh creative often** — TikTok creative fatigues faster than Meta (every 1-2 weeks)
- **Check placement breakdown** — sometimes Pangle (partner apps) drags down performance
- **Use Spark Ads** — boost organic TikTok posts as ads for a more native feel
