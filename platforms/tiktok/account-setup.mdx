# TikTok Ads Account Setup

This guide walks you through every step of setting up your TikTok Ads Manager account — from creating the account to installing tracking, verifying your business, and configuring payment. Follow along step by step.

<Tip>
**Before you start**: You need a TikTok account (personal or business) and either a website or a published app that you want to advertise. You do not need a large following — you can start advertising even with zero TikTok followers.
</Tip>

---

## Step 1: Create Your TikTok Ads Manager Account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to ads.tiktok.com">
    Open your browser and navigate to [ads.tiktok.com](https://ads.tiktok.com). Click **"Create an Ad"** or **"Get Started"**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign up or log in">
    You can sign up with:
    - An existing TikTok account
    - An email address
    - A phone number

    If you already have a TikTok Business Account, use those same credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your business information">
    TikTok will ask for:
    - **Business name**: Your company or app name
    - **Industry**: Select the closest match from the dropdown
    - **Country/Region**: Where your business is registered
    - **Currency**: The currency you want to use for billing (cannot be changed later, so choose carefully)
    - **Time zone**: Your local time zone (affects when "daily" budgets reset)
    - **Phone number**: For account verification
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accept the terms">
    Review and accept TikTok's advertising terms of service and privacy policy.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify your email or phone">
    TikTok sends a verification code. Enter it to confirm your account.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: Choose your **currency** and **time zone** carefully during setup — these cannot be changed after account creation. If you choose the wrong currency, you will need to create an entirely new account.
</Tip>

---

## Step 2: Complete Business Verification

TikTok requires business verification to unlock full advertising features. Without verification, you may have limited functionality.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Account Settings">
    In your Ads Manager dashboard, click your account name in the top right, then **Account Settings** or **Business Verification**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit your business documents">
    TikTok accepts various documents depending on your business type:

    | Business Type | Accepted Documents |
    |---|---|
    | **Corporation/LLC** | Business license, articles of incorporation, tax registration certificate |
    | **Sole proprietor** | Business license, government-issued ID |
    | **Individual** | Government-issued ID (passport, driver's license) |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for review">
    Verification typically takes **1-3 business days**. You will receive an email notification when it is approved.

    During the review period, you can still set up campaigns and tracking — you just cannot publish live ads until verification is complete.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: Submit your verification documents right away, even before you are ready to launch campaigns. The 1-3 day waiting period can be frustrating if you are ready to go but still waiting for approval. Get it out of the way early.
</Tip>

---

## Step 3: Set Up Payment

You need a valid payment method before launching any campaigns.

### Payment Options

| Payment Method | Availability | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Credit Card** | All regions | Visa, Mastercard, American Express, JCB |
| **Debit Card** | All regions | Must support recurring online payments |
| **PayPal** | Select regions | Check availability in your country |
| **Manual Payment** | Select regions | Pre-pay a balance, ads run until it is depleted |
| **Automatic Payment** | Most regions | TikTok charges your card automatically |

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Payment Settings">
    In Ads Manager, navigate to **Account > Payment** or click the billing/wallet icon.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose payment type">
    - **Automatic Payment**: TikTok charges your card when your balance reaches a threshold (recommended for most advertisers)
    - **Manual Payment**: You add funds in advance and ads stop when the balance runs out (good for strict budget control)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your payment method">
    Enter your credit/debit card details or connect PayPal. TikTok may make a small verification charge that is immediately refunded.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Pro Tip for beginners**: If you are worried about overspending, use **Manual Payment**. You add a specific amount (say $200), and once that money is spent, your ads stop automatically. No surprise bills. It is like a prepaid phone plan for advertising.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Connect Your App or Website

TikTok needs to know what you are promoting so it can track conversions and optimize your campaigns.

### For App Advertisers

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Assets > App">
    In Ads Manager, go to **Assets** in the top navigation, then click **App**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your app">
    Click **"Add App"** and enter your app's download URL:
    - **iOS**: Your App Store URL (e.g., `https://apps.apple.com/app/yourapp/id123456789`)
    - **Android**: Your Google Play URL (e.g., `https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yourapp`)
  </Step>
  <Step title="TikTok fetches your app info">
    TikTok automatically pulls your app name, icon, and description from the store listing. Verify that everything looks correct.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### For Website Advertisers

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Assets > Website">
    Go to **Assets > Website** and click **"Add Website"**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your domain">
    Enter your website domain (e.g., `www.yoursite.com`). TikTok will need to verify domain ownership.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify domain ownership">
    TikTok offers several verification methods:
    - Add a meta tag to your HTML `<head>`
    - Upload an HTML file to your web server
    - Add a DNS TXT record
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 5: Install TikTok Pixel (For Websites)

The TikTok Pixel is a JavaScript snippet that tracks user actions on your website. It is essential for conversion tracking and campaign optimization.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your Pixel">
    Go to **Assets > Events > Web Events** and click **"Create Pixel"**. Name your pixel something descriptive (e.g., "Main Website Pixel").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose installation method">
    TikTok offers two options:

    | Method | Best For | Difficulty |
    |---|---|---|
    | **Manual install** | Custom websites, developers | Moderate |
    | **Partner integration** | Shopify, WordPress, Google Tag Manager | Easy |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the base code">
    For manual installation, add this code to the `<head>` section of every page on your website:

    ```html
    <script>
    !function (w, d, t) {
      w.TiktokAnalyticsObject=t;
      var ttq=w[t]=w[t]||[];
      ttq.methods=["page","track","identify","instances","debug","on","off",
        "once","ready","alias","group","enableCookie","disableCookie"];
      ttq.setAndDefer=function(t,e){
        t[e]=function(){t.push([e].concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments,0)))}
      };
      for(var i=0;i<ttq.methods.length;i++)
        ttq.setAndDefer(ttq,ttq.methods[i]);
      ttq.instance=function(t){
        for(var e=ttq._i[t]||[],n=0;n<ttq.methods.length;n++)
          ttq.setAndDefer(e,ttq.methods[n]);
        return e
      };
      ttq.load=function(e,n){
        var i="https://analytics.tiktok.com/i18n/pixel/events.js";
        ttq._i=ttq._i||{};ttq._i[e]=[];ttq._i[e]._u=i;
        ttq._t=ttq._t||{};ttq._t[e]=+new Date;
        ttq._o=ttq._o||{};ttq._o[e]=n||{};
        var o=document.createElement("script");
        o.type="text/javascript";o.async=!0;o.src=i+"?sdkid="+e+"&lib="+t;
        var a=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];
        a.parentNode.insertBefore(o,a)
      };
      ttq.load('YOUR_PIXEL_ID');
      ttq.page();
    }(window, document, 'ttq');
    </script>
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_PIXEL_ID` with the pixel ID from your Ads Manager.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up events">
    Track specific user actions by adding event code to the relevant pages:

    ```javascript
    // Track a page view (already included in base code via ttq.page())

    // Track 'Add to Cart'
    ttq.track('AddToCart', {
      content_id: 'product_123',
      content_type: 'product',
      content_name: 'Premium Plan',
      quantity: 1,
      price: 9.99,
      value: 9.99,
      currency: 'USD'
    });

    // Track a purchase
    ttq.track('CompletePayment', {
      content_id: 'product_123',
      content_type: 'product',
      content_name: 'Premium Plan',
      quantity: 1,
      price: 9.99,
      value: 9.99,
      currency: 'USD'
    });

    // Track a registration/sign-up
    ttq.track('CompleteRegistration');
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the pixel is working">
    Install the **TikTok Pixel Helper** Chrome extension. Visit your website and check that events are firing correctly. Green checkmarks mean everything is working.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: If you use **Shopify**, **WordPress/WooCommerce**, or **Google Tag Manager**, use TikTok's partner integration instead of manual installation. It is much easier and handles event tracking automatically. Just search for the TikTok integration in your platform's app store or plugin directory.
</Tip>

## Step 6: Install TikTok SDK (For Apps)

If you are promoting a mobile app, install the TikTok SDK to track installs and in-app events.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="iOS (Swift)">
    **Step 1: Add the SDK via CocoaPods**

    ```ruby
    # Podfile
    pod 'TikTokBusinessSDK'
    ```

    Run `pod install` in your terminal.

    **Step 2: Initialize the SDK**

    ```swift
    import TikTokBusinessSDK

    // In your AppDelegate
    func application(
      _ application: UIApplication,
      didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
    ) -> Bool {

      let config = TikTokConfig(appId: "YOUR_APP_ID", tiktokAppId: "YOUR_TIKTOK_APP_ID")
      config.setLogLevel(.debug) // Remove in production
      TikTokBusiness.initializeSdk(config)

      return true
    }
    ```

    **Step 3: Track events**

    ```swift
    // Track a purchase
    TikTokBusiness.trackEvent("Purchase", withProperties: [
      "content_id": "premium_plan",
      "content_type": "product",
      "currency": "USD",
      "value": 9.99
    ])

    // Track registration
    TikTokBusiness.trackEvent("CompleteRegistration")

    // Track a custom event
    TikTokBusiness.trackEvent("LevelComplete", withProperties: [
      "level": 10
    ])
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Android (Kotlin)">
    **Step 1: Add the SDK via Gradle**

    ```kotlin
    // build.gradle (app level)
    dependencies {
      implementation 'com.tiktok.business.sdk:tiktok-business-android-sdk:1.+'
    }
    ```

    **Step 2: Initialize the SDK**

    ```kotlin
    import com.tiktok.TikTokBusinessSdk

    class MyApplication : Application() {
      override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        val config = TikTokBusinessSdk.TTConfig(this)
          .setAppId("YOUR_APP_ID")
          .setTTAppId("YOUR_TIKTOK_APP_ID")
          .setLogLevel(TikTokBusinessSdk.LogLevel.DEBUG) // Remove in production

        TikTokBusinessSdk.initializeSdk(config)
      }
    }
    ```

    **Step 3: Track events**

    ```kotlin
    // Track a purchase
    TikTokBusinessSdk.trackEvent("Purchase", JSONObject().apply {
      put("content_id", "premium_plan")
      put("content_type", "product")
      put("currency", "USD")
      put("value", 9.99)
    })

    // Track registration
    TikTokBusinessSdk.trackEvent("CompleteRegistration")
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="React Native">
    ```bash
    # Install the package
    npm install tiktok-business-sdk-react-native
    # or
    yarn add tiktok-business-sdk-react-native
    ```

    ```typescript
    import TikTokBusiness from 'tiktok-business-sdk-react-native';

    // Initialize (typically in App.tsx or index.js)
    TikTokBusiness.initializeSdk({
      appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
      tiktokAppId: 'YOUR_TIKTOK_APP_ID',
      debug: __DEV__, // Enable debug in development only
    });

    // Track events
    TikTokBusiness.trackEvent('Purchase', {
      content_id: 'premium_plan',
      content_type: 'product',
      currency: 'USD',
      value: 9.99,
    });

    TikTokBusiness.trackEvent('CompleteRegistration');
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

---

## Step 7: Set Up Events API (Server-to-Server)

The Events API sends conversion data from your server directly to TikTok, bypassing browser limitations. This provides more reliable tracking, especially with iOS privacy changes.

```python
# Python example using requests
import requests
import hashlib
import json
import time

PIXEL_CODE = "YOUR_PIXEL_ID"
ACCESS_TOKEN = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"

def send_event_to_tiktok(event_name, email, event_id, value=None):
    url = f"https://business-api.tiktok.com/open_api/v1.3/pixel/track/"

    # Hash the email (TikTok requires SHA256 hashing)
    hashed_email = hashlib.sha256(email.lower().strip().encode()).hexdigest()

    payload = {
        "pixel_code": PIXEL_CODE,
        "event": event_name,
        "event_id": event_id,  # Use same event_id as client-side for deduplication
        "timestamp": int(time.time()),
        "context": {
            "user": {
                "email": hashed_email
            }
        }
    }

    if value:
        payload["properties"] = {
            "value": value,
            "currency": "USD"
        }

    headers = {
        "Access-Token": ACCESS_TOKEN,
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
    return response.json()

# Example usage
send_event_to_tiktok(
    event_name="CompletePayment",
    email="user@example.com",
    event_id="unique-event-id-123",
    value=29.99
)
```

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: When using both client-side (Pixel/SDK) and server-side (Events API) tracking, use the same **event_id** for each conversion. TikTok uses this ID to deduplicate events, so the same conversion is not counted twice. This is critical for accurate reporting.
</Tip>

---

## Step 8: Configure Events in Events Manager

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Events Manager">
    In Ads Manager, navigate to **Assets > Events**. You will see your Pixel and/or App events listed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify events are firing">
    TikTok shows recent events in real-time. Visit your website or open your app and trigger some events. They should appear in the Events Manager within a few minutes.

    | Status | Meaning | Action |
    |---|---|---|
    | **Active (green)** | Events are firing correctly | No action needed |
    | **No recent activity (yellow)** | No events received recently | Check installation |
    | **Inactive (red)** | No events ever received | Installation may be incorrect |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up event optimization">
    Tell TikTok which events you want to optimize for. In your ad campaign, you will select one of these events as your **optimization goal**. Common choices:

    - **App install**: Optimize for the most installs at the lowest cost
    - **CompleteRegistration**: Optimize for users who sign up
    - **Purchase / CompletePayment**: Optimize for users who buy something
    - **AddToCart**: Optimize for users who show purchase intent
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Step 9: Set Up TikTok Business Account (Optional but Recommended)

A TikTok Business Account (on the TikTok app itself, not Ads Manager) gives you additional features:

- **Profile analytics**: See who visits your TikTok profile
- **Content analytics**: Detailed data on your organic TikToks
- **Bio link**: Add a clickable link to your profile
- **Commercial music library**: Access to music you can use in ads without copyright issues
- **Spark Ads eligibility**: Boost your organic content as paid ads

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the TikTok app">
    Go to your TikTok profile and tap the **three lines** menu icon.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Settings > Account">
    Tap **Settings and privacy > Account > Switch to Business Account**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your category">
    Select the category that best describes your business. This does not affect your ads — it just helps TikTok provide relevant tips and insights.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: Even if you do not plan to post organic TikToks, switch to a Business Account. It unlocks Spark Ads, which let you boost other creators' content (with their permission). Spark Ads consistently outperform regular In-Feed Ads because they look like organic content.
</Tip>

## Common Setup Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My Pixel events are not showing up">
    Common causes: (1) Ad blocker in your browser is blocking the pixel, (2) the pixel code is not on the page you are testing, (3) you need to wait a few minutes for events to appear. Try disabling ad blockers and using the TikTok Pixel Helper Chrome extension to debug.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Business verification is taking too long">
    Typical review time is 1-3 business days. If it has been longer, check your email for requests for additional documents. You can also contact TikTok support through the Ads Manager help center.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I chose the wrong currency">
    Unfortunately, currency cannot be changed after account creation. You will need to create a new Ads Manager account with the correct currency. This is a common mistake, so double-check before confirming.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="My SDK is not tracking app installs">
    Make sure you have: (1) added the correct App ID and TikTok App ID, (2) initialized the SDK before any events fire, (3) tested on a real device (not just a simulator), and (4) given it a few minutes for data to appear in Events Manager.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use an MMP instead of TikTok's SDK?">
    Yes. If you use an MMP like AppsFlyer, Adjust, or Airbridge, you can configure TikTok as a partner in your MMP dashboard. The MMP handles tracking and sends postbacks to TikTok. This is actually the preferred approach if you advertise on multiple platforms, because it gives you deduplicated attribution across all channels.
  </Accordion>
