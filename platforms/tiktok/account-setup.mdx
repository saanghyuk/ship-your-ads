## Getting started with TikTok Ads Manager

TikTok's ad platform is relatively new compared to Meta and Google, but it's matured quickly. The setup process is similar to Meta's Business Manager — you'll create an account, install tracking, and configure your settings.

## What you'll learn

- How to create a TikTok Ads Manager account
- How to install the TikTok Pixel (web) or SDK (app)
- How to configure events and conversion tracking
- How to set up payment and budget controls
- How to verify everything is working

## Account creation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to TikTok Ads Manager">
    Visit [ads.tiktok.com](https://ads.tiktok.com) and click **Create an Ad** or **Get Started**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Register your account">
    Enter your email and create a password. You don't need a TikTok account to run ads (though having one helps).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter business information">
    - Business name (legal business name)
    - Industry category
    - Business website or app store URL
    - Business address and phone number
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for approval">
    TikTok reviews new accounts, usually within 24 hours. Some accounts are approved instantly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up payment">
    Add a credit card or set up automatic payments. TikTok also supports PayPal in some regions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Use real business information.** Like Meta, TikTok bans accounts that look fraudulent. Mismatched business names, fake addresses, or suspicious payment methods can get your account rejected or banned.
</Warning>

## Installing tracking

### For mobile apps: TikTok SDK

TikTok's SDK tracks app installs and in-app events:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an App in TikTok Events Manager">
    In Ads Manager, go to **Assets** > **Events** > **App Events** > **Create App**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your integration method">
    **Option A: TikTok SDK** — direct integration

    **Option B: Third-party MMP** (Adjust, AppsFlyer, Branch, etc.) — if you already use one

    Most developers with an existing MMP should use Option B for cleaner attribution.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the SDK (if using Option A)">
    **iOS (CocoaPods):**
    ```ruby
    pod 'TikTokBusinessSDK'
    ```

    **Android (Gradle):**
    ```groovy
    implementation 'com.tiktok.business.sdk:tiktok-business-android-sdk:latest.release'
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize the SDK">
    Follow TikTok's initialization code for your platform. You'll need your **App ID** from the TikTok Ads dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure events">
    Set up the key events TikTok should track (install, registration, purchase, etc.).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### For websites: TikTok Pixel

If you drive traffic to a landing page first:

```html
<script>
!function (w, d, t) {
  w.TiktokAnalyticsObject=t;var ttq=w[t]=w[t]||[];
  ttq.methods=["page","track","identify","instances","debug","on","off","once","ready","alias","group","enableCookie","disableCookie"];
  ttq.setAndDefer=function(t,e){t[e]=function(){t.push([e].concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments,0)))}};
  for(var i=0;i<ttq.methods.length;i++)ttq.setAndDefer(ttq,ttq.methods[i]);
  ttq.instance=function(t){for(var e=ttq._i[t]||[],n=0;n<ttq.methods.length;n++)ttq.setAndDefer(e,ttq.methods[n]);return e};
  ttq.load=function(e,n){var i="https://analytics.tiktok.com/i18n/pixel/events.js";
  ttq._i=ttq._i||{};ttq._i[e]=[];ttq._i[e]._u=i;ttq._t=ttq._t||{};ttq._t[e+\"_\"+n]=+new Date;
  (document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0]||document.body).appendChild(document.createElement("script")).src=i+"?sdkid="+e+"&lib="+t};
  ttq.load('YOUR_PIXEL_ID');
  ttq.page();
}(window, document, 'ttq');
</script>
```

## Key events to configure

| Event | When to fire | Priority |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `InstallApp` | App is installed | High (automatic with SDK) |
| `CompleteRegistration` | User signs up | High |
| `CompletePurchase` | User makes a purchase | High |
| `AddToCart` | User adds item to cart | Medium |
| `ViewContent` | User views key content | Medium |

<Note>
  If you're using a third-party MMP, events are configured in your MMP dashboard and forwarded to TikTok automatically. This is generally more reliable than direct SDK integration.
</Note>

## Verify your setup

1. Go to **Events Manager** in TikTok Ads Manager
2. Check that your app or pixel shows as **Active**
3. Use the **Test Events** tool to send test events from your device
4. Verify events are received within a few minutes

## Account setup checklist

- [ ] TikTok Ads Manager account created and approved
- [ ] Payment method added
- [ ] TikTok SDK or Pixel installed
- [ ] Key events configured
