## Getting everything connected before you spend a dollar

TikTok's ad platform has matured significantly. The setup is similar to Meta's Business Manager — create an account, install tracking, configure events, and set up payment. There are a few extra steps compared to Apple Search Ads, but each one is straightforward.

This guide walks through every step, including code examples for installing the TikTok SDK in your app.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details | Notes |
|------------|---------|-------|
| **Email address** | For your TikTok Ads Manager account | Does not need to match a TikTok account |
| **Business information** | Legal name, address, phone, website or app store URL | Must be real — fake info gets accounts banned |
| **Payment method** | Credit card, debit card, or PayPal (in some regions) | Must match your business information |
| **App store listing** (for app campaigns) | Your app must be live on the App Store or Google Play | TikTok needs to verify your app exists |
| **TikTok account** (optional but recommended) | For running Spark Ads and building organic presence | Free to create at tiktok.com |

<Note>
  **You do NOT need a TikTok account to run ads.** The Ads Manager is a separate system. However, having a TikTok account lets you run Spark Ads (boosted organic posts), which are often the best-performing format.
</Note>

## Step 1: Create your TikTok Business Account

A TikTok Business Account is a free upgrade to a regular TikTok account that gives you access to analytics, the commercial music library, and the ability to link to Ads Manager.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to TikTok for Business">
    Visit [business.tiktok.com](https://business.tiktok.com) and click **Create Now** or **Get Started**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create or log in">
    You can either:
    - **Create a new account** with your email
    - **Log in with an existing TikTok account** and upgrade it to a Business Account

    If you already have a TikTok account with followers, log in with that — you will be able to use your organic content as Spark Ads.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your business category">
    Choose the category that best describes your business. This helps TikTok with ad review and does not affect targeting.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete your business profile">
    Add:
    - Business name
    - Profile photo (your app icon works great)
    - Bio (brief description of what your app does)
    - Website URL or app store link
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Set up TikTok Ads Manager

TikTok Ads Manager is the separate dashboard where you create, manage, and analyze your ad campaigns.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to TikTok Ads Manager">
    Visit [ads.tiktok.com](https://ads.tiktok.com) and click **Create an Ad** or **Get Started**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Register your account">
    Enter:
    - **Email address** — will be your login
    - **Password** — create a strong password
    - **Verification code** — TikTok sends a code to your email

    If you already logged in with your TikTok account, some of this may be pre-filled.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter business information">
    Fill in all required fields:

    | Field | What to enter | Example |
    |-------|-------------|---------|
    | **Country/Region** | Where your business is registered | United States |
    | **Industry** | Your app's category | Technology / Apps |
    | **Legal business name** | Your company's legal name | YourApp Inc. |
    | **Business address** | Your registered business address | 123 Main St, San Francisco, CA |
    | **Phone number** | Business phone number | +1-555-123-4567 |
    | **Business website** | Your website or app store URL | https://apps.apple.com/app/yourapp/id12345 |
    | **Tax information** | Tax ID or VAT number (if applicable) | May be required in some regions |

    <Warning>
      **Use real, accurate business information.** TikTok actively verifies this. Mismatched names, addresses that do not exist, or obviously fake information will get your account rejected or banned. If you are a solo developer, use your real name and address.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for account review">
    TikTok reviews new accounts. This can take:
    - **Instant** — some accounts are auto-approved
    - **24 hours** — standard review time
    - **2-3 days** — if additional verification is needed

    You will receive an email when your account is approved.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Log in to your approved account">
    Once approved, log in to [ads.tiktok.com](https://ads.tiktok.com). You will see the Ads Manager dashboard with sections for Campaigns, Assets, Reporting, and more.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Business verification (recommended)

Business verification is optional for basic ad campaigns but gives you additional benefits and trust signals.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to business verification">
    In Ads Manager, go to **Account Settings** (gear icon) > **Business Verification**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload documents">
    TikTok may ask for:
    - Business registration certificate
    - Tax documents
    - Proof of address
    - Government-issued ID of the account owner

    The exact requirements vary by country.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for verification">
    Verification typically takes 2-5 business days. Once verified, your account gets:
    - Higher spending limits
    - Access to more ad features
    - Better support priority
    - Lower risk of account suspension
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **You can start running ads without business verification.** Do not let this step delay your launch. Start advertising and complete verification in parallel.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Set up payment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to payment settings">
    In Ads Manager, go to **Account Settings** > **Payment** > **Payment Method**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose payment type">
    TikTok offers two payment models:

    | Type | How it works | Best for |
    |------|-------------|----------|
    | **Automatic payments** | TikTok charges your card when you hit a threshold or at the end of billing cycle | Most advertisers (recommended) |
    | **Manual payments** | You prepay a balance and TikTok deducts from it | Strict budget control |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your payment method">
    **For automatic payments:**
    - Enter credit or debit card details (Visa, Mastercard, AMEX)
    - PayPal is available in some regions
    - The billing address must match your card

    **For manual payments:**
    - Choose a prepayment amount (minimum varies by region)
    - Pay via credit card, PayPal, or local payment methods
    - Your balance appears in the account and is deducted as ads run
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set a spending limit (recommended)">
    Go to **Account Settings** > **Account Budget** and set a maximum spending limit. This prevents accidental overspending while you learn.

    **Recommended starting limit:** $500 - $1,000 for your first month.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Understanding TikTok billing

| Billing aspect | Details |
|---------------|---------|
| **Billing threshold** | Starts low ($20-50), increases as you build payment history |
| **When you are charged** | When you hit the threshold OR at month end |
| **Currency** | Based on your billing country |
| **Payment failure** | All campaigns pause until resolved; fix within 24 hours |
| **Refunds** | TikTok generally does not refund ad spend |
| **Invoice** | Available in Account Settings > Billing |

## Step 5: Connect your app to TikTok

Before you can run app install campaigns, TikTok needs to know about your app.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Events Manager">
    In Ads Manager, navigate to **Assets** > **Events**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click 'Manage' under App Events">
    Select **App Events** and click **Manage**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new app">
    Click **Create App** and enter:
    - **App name** — your app's name
    - **App Store URL** or **Google Play URL** — the link to your app listing
    - **Platform** — iOS, Android, or both

    TikTok will verify that your app exists in the store.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your integration method">
    This is a critical choice:

    | Method | When to use | Effort |
    |--------|-------------|--------|
    | **TikTok SDK** | You want direct integration with no third-party tools | Medium |
    | **Third-party MMP** (AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, Singular, Kochava) | You already use an MMP or plan to run ads on multiple platforms | Low (MMP handles it) |
    | **Events API** (server-to-server) | You want server-side tracking for maximum reliability | Higher |

    <Tip>
      **If you are running ads on multiple platforms (Meta, Google, Apple, TikTok), use an MMP.** It gives you unified attribution across all channels and avoids double-counting installs. AppsFlyer and Adjust are the most popular choices.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 6: Install TikTok tracking

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TikTok SDK — iOS (Swift)">
    ### Step 1: Install via CocoaPods

    Add to your `Podfile`:

    ```ruby
    pod 'TikTokBusinessSDK'
    ```

    Then run:

    ```bash
    cd ios && pod install
    ```

    ### Step 2: Configure your App ID

    Get your TikTok App ID from **Events Manager** > **App Events** > your app > **Details**.

    ### Step 3: Initialize the SDK

    In your `AppDelegate.swift`:

    ```swift
    import UIKit
    import TikTokBusinessSDK

    @main
    class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

        func application(
            _ application: UIApplication,
            didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
        ) -> Bool {

            // Configure TikTok SDK
            let config = TikTokConfig(appId: "YOUR_APP_ID", tiktokAppId: "YOUR_TIKTOK_APP_ID")

            // Enable automatic event tracking (recommended)
            config.setLogLevel(.info) // Use .none in production

            // Initialize
            TikTokBusiness.initializeSdk(config) { success, error in
                if success {
                    print("TikTok SDK initialized successfully")
                } else {
                    print("TikTok SDK initialization failed: \(String(describing: error))")
                }
            }

            return true
        }
    }
    ```

    ### Step 4: Track events

    ```swift
    import TikTokBusinessSDK

    // Track app install (automatic with SDK)

    // Track registration
    TikTokBusiness.trackEvent("CompleteRegistration", withProperties: [
        "method": "email"
    ])

    // Track purchase
    TikTokBusiness.trackEvent("Purchase", withProperties: [
        "value": 9.99,
        "currency": "USD",
        "content_type": "subscription",
        "content_id": "premium_monthly"
    ])

    // Track add to cart
    TikTokBusiness.trackEvent("AddToCart", withProperties: [
        "value": 29.99,
        "currency": "USD",
        "content_id": "product_123"
    ])

    // Track custom events
    TikTokBusiness.trackEvent("LevelComplete", withProperties: [
        "level": 5,
        "score": 1200
    ])
    ```

    ### Step 5: Handle iOS App Tracking Transparency (ATT)

    iOS 14.5+ requires user permission for tracking. Add to `Info.plist`:

    ```xml
    <key>NSUserTrackingUsageDescription</key>
    <string>We use this to provide you with a better ad experience.</string>
    ```

    Request permission in your app:

    ```swift
    import AppTrackingTransparency

    func requestTrackingPermission() {
        if #available(iOS 14, *) {
            ATTrackingManager.requestTrackingAuthorization { status in
                switch status {
                case .authorized:
                    print("Tracking authorized")
                case .denied:
                    print("Tracking denied")
                case .notDetermined:
                    print("Tracking not determined")
                case .restricted:
                    print("Tracking restricted")
                @unknown default:
                    break
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    <Warning>
      **Ask for tracking permission AFTER the user has experienced value from your app.** Asking on first launch results in very low opt-in rates (15-25%). Asking after the user has completed onboarding or used a feature results in much higher rates (35-50%).
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="TikTok SDK — Android (Kotlin)">
    ### Step 1: Add the dependency

    In your app's `build.gradle`:

    ```groovy
    dependencies {
        implementation 'com.tiktok.business.sdk:tiktok-business-android-sdk:1.+'
    }
    ```

    Add the TikTok Maven repository if not already present:

    ```groovy
    // In your project-level build.gradle or settings.gradle
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://artifact.bytedance.com/repository/releases/" }
    }
    ```

    ### Step 2: Initialize the SDK

    In your `Application` class:

    ```kotlin
    import android.app.Application
    import com.tiktok.TikTokBusinessSdk

    class MyApplication : Application() {

        override fun onCreate() {
            super.onCreate()

            // Configure TikTok SDK
            val config = TikTokBusinessSdk.TTConfig(this)
                .setAppId("YOUR_APP_ID")
                .setTTAppId("YOUR_TIKTOK_APP_ID")
                .setLogLevel(TikTokBusinessSdk.LogLevel.INFO) // Use NONE in production

            // Initialize
            TikTokBusinessSdk.initializeSdk(config)
        }
    }
    ```

    ### Step 3: Track events

    ```kotlin
    import com.tiktok.TikTokBusinessSdk
    import org.json.JSONObject

    // Track registration
    val regProps = JSONObject().apply {
        put("method", "email")
    }
    TikTokBusinessSdk.trackEvent("CompleteRegistration", regProps)

    // Track purchase
    val purchaseProps = JSONObject().apply {
        put("value", 9.99)
        put("currency", "USD")
        put("content_type", "subscription")
        put("content_id", "premium_monthly")
    }
    TikTokBusinessSdk.trackEvent("Purchase", purchaseProps)

    // Track custom events
    val customProps = JSONObject().apply {
        put("level", 5)
        put("score", 1200)
    }
    TikTokBusinessSdk.trackEvent("LevelComplete", customProps)
    ```

    ### Step 4: Add required permissions

    In `AndroidManifest.xml`:

    ```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
    <!-- Optional: for better attribution -->
    <uses-permission android:name="com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID" />
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="React Native">
    ### Option A: Using a third-party MMP (recommended)

    If you use AppsFlyer, Adjust, or Branch, the MMP SDK handles TikTok attribution automatically. You configure the TikTok integration in your MMP dashboard and do not need the TikTok SDK in your app.

    **Example with AppsFlyer:**

    ```bash
    npm install react-native-appsflyer
    cd ios && pod install
    ```

    ```typescript
    import appsFlyer from 'react-native-appsflyer';

    // Initialize AppsFlyer (which handles TikTok attribution)
    appsFlyer.initSdk({
      devKey: 'YOUR_APPSFLYER_DEV_KEY',
      isDebug: false,
      appId: 'YOUR_IOS_APP_ID', // iOS only
      onInstallConversionDataListener: true,
    });

    // Track events (forwarded to TikTok automatically)
    appsFlyer.logEvent('af_purchase', {
      af_revenue: 9.99,
      af_currency: 'USD',
      af_content_id: 'premium_monthly',
    });
    ```

    Then in the AppsFlyer dashboard, enable TikTok as an integrated partner and enter your TikTok App ID.

    ### Option B: Direct TikTok SDK integration

    If you want to use the TikTok SDK directly in React Native, you need a native module bridge since there is no official React Native package.

    **iOS side** (`ios/TikTokSDKBridge.swift`):

    ```swift
    import Foundation
    import TikTokBusinessSDK

    @objc(TikTokSDKBridge)
    class TikTokSDKBridge: NSObject {

      @objc
      func initialize(
        _ appId: String,
        tiktokAppId: String,
        resolver resolve: @escaping RCTPromiseResolveBlock,
        rejecter reject: @escaping RCTPromiseRejectBlock
      ) {
        let config = TikTokConfig(appId: appId, tiktokAppId: tiktokAppId)
        TikTokBusiness.initializeSdk(config) { success, error in
          if success {
            resolve(true)
          } else {
            reject("INIT_FAILED", "TikTok SDK init failed", error)
          }
        }
      }

      @objc
      func trackEvent(
        _ eventName: String,
        properties: NSDictionary,
        resolver resolve: @escaping RCTPromiseResolveBlock,
        rejecter reject: @escaping RCTPromiseRejectBlock
      ) {
        if let props = properties as? [String: Any] {
          TikTokBusiness.trackEvent(eventName, withProperties: props)
        } else {
          TikTokBusiness.trackEvent(eventName)
        }
        resolve(true)
      }

      @objc
      static func requiresMainQueueSetup() -> Bool {
        return false
      }
    }
    ```

    **Objective-C bridge** (`ios/TikTokSDKBridge.m`):

    ```objc
    #import <React/RCTBridgeModule.h>

    @interface RCT_EXTERN_MODULE(TikTokSDKBridge, NSObject)

    RCT_EXTERN_METHOD(initialize:(NSString *)appId
                      tiktokAppId:(NSString *)tiktokAppId
                      resolver:(RCTPromiseResolveBlock)resolve
                      rejecter:(RCTPromiseRejectBlock)reject)

    RCT_EXTERN_METHOD(trackEvent:(NSString *)eventName
                      properties:(NSDictionary *)properties
                      resolver:(RCTPromiseResolveBlock)resolve
                      rejecter:(RCTPromiseRejectBlock)reject)

    @end
    ```

    **TypeScript usage:**

    ```typescript
    import { NativeModules, Platform } from 'react-native';

    const { TikTokSDKBridge } = NativeModules;

    // Initialize on app startup
    async function initTikTokSDK(): Promise<void> {
      if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
        try {
          await TikTokSDKBridge.initialize(
            'YOUR_APP_ID',
            'YOUR_TIKTOK_APP_ID'
          );
          console.log('TikTok SDK initialized');
        } catch (error) {
          console.error('TikTok SDK init failed:', error);
        }
      }
    }

    // Track events
    async function trackTikTokEvent(
      eventName: string,
      properties: Record<string, any> = {}
    ): Promise<void> {
      try {
        await TikTokSDKBridge.trackEvent(eventName, properties);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('TikTok event tracking failed:', error);
      }
    }

    // Usage examples
    trackTikTokEvent('CompleteRegistration', { method: 'email' });
    trackTikTokEvent('Purchase', {
      value: 9.99,
      currency: 'USD',
      content_id: 'premium_monthly',
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="TikTok Pixel (Web)">
    If you drive traffic to a website or landing page before the app store, install the TikTok Pixel.

    ### Step 1: Create a Pixel

    In Ads Manager, go to **Assets** > **Events** > **Web Events** > **Manage** > **Create Pixel**.

    Name your pixel and choose the installation method:

    | Method | Best for |
    |--------|---------|
    | **Manual installation** | Developers who want full control |
    | **Partner integration** | Shopify, WordPress, Google Tag Manager, etc. |

    ### Step 2: Install the base code

    Add this code to the `<head>` section of every page on your website:

    ```html
    <script>
    !function (w, d, t) {
      w.TiktokAnalyticsObject=t;
      var ttq=w[t]=w[t]||[];
      ttq.methods=["page","track","identify","instances","debug","on","off",
        "once","ready","alias","group","enableCookie","disableCookie",
        "holdConsent","revokeConsent","grantConsent"];
      ttq.setAndDefer=function(t,e){
        t[e]=function(){t.push([e].concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments,0)))}
      };
      for(var i=0;i<ttq.methods.length;i++)
        ttq.setAndDefer(ttq,ttq.methods[i]);
      ttq.instance=function(t){
        for(var e=ttq._i[t]||[],n=0;n<ttq.methods.length;n++)
          ttq.setAndDefer(e,ttq.methods[n]);
        return e
      };
      ttq.load=function(e,n){
        var o="https://analytics.tiktok.com/i18n/pixel/events.js",
            s=n&&n.partner;
        ttq._i=ttq._i||{};ttq._i[e]=[];ttq._i[e]._u=o;
        ttq._t=ttq._t||{};ttq._t[e+\"_\"+n]=+new Date;
        var r=d.createElement("script");
        r.type="text/javascript";r.async=!0;r.src=o+"?sdkid="+e+"&lib="+t;
        var a=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];
        a.parentNode.insertBefore(r,a)
      };
      ttq.load('YOUR_PIXEL_ID');
      ttq.page();
    }(window, document, 'ttq');
    </script>
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_PIXEL_ID` with your actual pixel ID from Events Manager.

    ### Step 3: Track events

    Add event tracking code where relevant actions occur:

    ```javascript
    // Page view (automatic with ttq.page() above)

    // User clicks "Download" button
    ttq.track('ClickButton', {
      content_name: 'Download App',
      content_id: 'download_cta'
    });

    // User signs up on your website
    ttq.track('CompleteRegistration', {
      content_name: 'Website Signup'
    });

    // User makes a purchase on your website
    ttq.track('CompletePayment', {
      value: 29.99,
      currency: 'USD',
      content_type: 'product',
      content_id: 'premium_plan'
    });

    // User adds item to cart
    ttq.track('AddToCart', {
      value: 29.99,
      currency: 'USD',
      content_id: 'premium_plan'
    });

    // User views a product/content page
    ttq.track('ViewContent', {
      content_name: 'Pricing Page',
      content_id: 'pricing'
    });
    ```

    ### Step 4: Install via Google Tag Manager (alternative)

    If you use Google Tag Manager:

    1. In GTM, create a new **Custom HTML** tag
    2. Paste the TikTok Pixel base code

  <Tab title="Events API (Server-to-Server)">
    The Events API lets you send events directly from your server to TikTok. This is the most reliable method and works even when the SDK or Pixel cannot fire (ad blockers, iOS privacy restrictions).

    ### Step 1: Generate an access token

    In Ads Manager, go to **Assets** > **Events** > your app or pixel > **Settings** > **Generate Access Token**.

    Save this token securely — it is used to authenticate your API calls.

    ### Step 2: Send events

    ```python
    import requests
    import json
    import hashlib
    import time

    ACCESS_TOKEN = "your_access_token"
    PIXEL_CODE = "your_pixel_code"  # or App ID

    def send_event_to_tiktok(event_name, user_data, properties=None):
        """Send a conversion event to TikTok Events API."""

        url = "https://business-api.tiktok.com/open_api/v1.3/event/track/"

        # Hash user identifiers (required by TikTok)
        hashed_email = hashlib.sha256(
            user_data.get("email", "").lower().encode()
        ).hexdigest() if user_data.get("email") else None

        hashed_phone = hashlib.sha256(
            user_data.get("phone", "").encode()
        ).hexdigest() if user_data.get("phone") else None

        payload = {
            "pixel_code": PIXEL_CODE,
            "event": event_name,
            "event_id": f"{event_name}_{int(time.time())}",  # Deduplicate
            "timestamp": int(time.time()),
            "context": {
                "user_agent": user_data.get("user_agent", ""),
                "ip": user_data.get("ip", ""),
            },
            "properties": properties or {},
        }

        # Add hashed user data
        if hashed_email:
            payload["context"]["user"] = {"email": hashed_email}
        if hashed_phone:
            payload["context"]["user"]["phone_number"] = hashed_phone

        headers = {
            "Access-Token": ACCESS_TOKEN,
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
        }

        response = requests.post(
            url,
            headers=headers,
            data=json.dumps({"data": [payload]})
        )

        return response.json()


    # Example usage
    result = send_event_to_tiktok(
        event_name="CompleteRegistration",
        user_data={
            "email": "user@example.com",
            "ip": "123.45.67.89",
            "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
        },
        properties={
            "content_name": "Premium Signup",
        }
    )
    print(result)
    ```

    ```typescript
    // Node.js / TypeScript version
    import crypto from 'crypto';

    const ACCESS_TOKEN = 'your_access_token';
    const PIXEL_CODE = 'your_pixel_code';

    interface UserData {
      email?: string;
      phone?: string;
      ip?: string;
      userAgent?: string;
    }

    async function sendTikTokEvent(
      eventName: string,
      userData: UserData,
      properties?: Record<string, any>
    ): Promise<any> {
      const hashedEmail = userData.email
        ? crypto.createHash('sha256').update(userData.email.toLowerCase()).digest('hex')
        : undefined;

      const payload = {
        data: [{
          pixel_code: PIXEL_CODE,
          event: eventName,
          event_id: `${eventName}_${Date.now()}`,
          timestamp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
          context: {
            user_agent: userData.userAgent || '',
            ip: userData.ip || '',
            user: hashedEmail ? { email: hashedEmail } : undefined,
          },
          properties: properties || {},
        }],
      };

      const response = await fetch(
        'https://business-api.tiktok.com/open_api/v1.3/event/track/',
        {
          method: 'POST',
          headers: {
            'Access-Token': ACCESS_TOKEN,
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          },
          body: JSON.stringify(payload),
        }
      );

      return response.json();
    }

    // Usage
    await sendTikTokEvent(
      'CompleteRegistration',
      { email: 'user@example.com', ip: '123.45.67.89' },
      { content_name: 'Premium Signup' }
    );
    ```

    <Tip>
      **Use both SDK/Pixel AND Events API for maximum accuracy.** Send events from both client and server, and use the `event_id` field to deduplicate. TikTok recommends this "dual setup" approach.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>

## Step 7: Configure events in Events Manager

After installing tracking, configure which events TikTok should optimize for.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Events Manager">
    In Ads Manager, navigate to **Assets** > **Events**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your app or pixel">
    Click on the app or pixel you configured.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review detected events">
    If your SDK or Pixel is working, you should see events appearing. TikTok shows:
    - Event name
    - Event count
    - Last received timestamp
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure optimization events">
    For each event, decide if it should be available as an optimization goal in campaigns:

    | Event | When to fire | Priority for optimization |
    |-------|-------------|-------------------------|
    | **InstallApp** | App is installed (automatic with SDK) | High — use for app install campaigns |
    | **CompleteRegistration** | User creates an account | High — use if registration is your key metric |
    | **CompletePurchase** | User makes an in-app purchase | High — use for revenue optimization |
    | **AddToCart** | User adds item to cart | Medium — good for e-commerce |
    | **ViewContent** | User views key content | Medium — good for engagement |
    | **Subscribe** | User starts a subscription | High — use for subscription apps |
    | **StartTrial** | User starts a free trial | High — good for freemium apps |
    | Custom events | Your own events | Depends on your business |
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 8: Verify everything works

Before spending money on ads, verify that tracking is functioning correctly.

### For SDK (app tracking)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable debug mode">
    Set the SDK log level to debug/info during testing (see code examples above).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the app on a test device">
    Install your app from TestFlight (iOS) or an APK (Android).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Perform test actions">
    Open the app, create an account, make a test purchase — trigger each event you configured.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Events Manager">
    In Events Manager, look for your test events. They should appear within 5-15 minutes.

    If events are not appearing:
    - Check that the App ID and TikTok App ID are correct
    - Verify the SDK is initialized before events are tracked
    - Check your device's internet connection
    - Look at debug logs for error messages
  </Step>
</Steps>

### For Pixel (web tracking)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install TikTok Pixel Helper">
    Install the **TikTok Pixel Helper** Chrome extension from the Chrome Web Store. It shows you whether the pixel is firing correctly on your website.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Visit your website">
    Open your website in Chrome. The Pixel Helper icon should light up green, showing detected events.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trigger events">
    Click buttons, fill forms, and complete the actions that should fire events. Verify each one appears in the Pixel Helper.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Events Manager">
    Verify events appear in Events Manager. They should show within minutes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### For Events API

<Steps>
  <Step title="Send a test event">
    Use the code examples above to send a test event from your server.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check the API response">
    A successful response looks like:
    ```json
    {
      "code": 0,
      "message": "OK",
      "data": {}
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify in Events Manager">
    Check that the test event appears in Events Manager within a few minutes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 9: Set up TikTok Events Manager advanced features

### Custom conversions

Custom conversions let you create conversion events from URL rules (for web) or event parameters (for app).

Example: Create a "High Value Purchase" custom conversion that only fires when the purchase amount is above $50.

1. Go to **Events Manager** > **Custom Conversions**
2. Click **Create Custom Conversion**
3. Set the rules (e.g., event = Purchase AND value > 50)
4. Name it and save

### Audience creation from events

You can create audiences based on event data for retargeting:

1. Go to **Assets** > **Audiences**
2. Click **Create Audience** > **Custom Audience**
3. Choose **App Activity** or **Website Traffic**
4. Define the audience (e.g., "Users who added to cart but didn't purchase in the last 7 days")
5. Save the audience for use in ad targeting
