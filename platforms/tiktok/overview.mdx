## The platform everyone underestimates

TikTok isn't just for dance videos anymore. With over 1 billion monthly active users and some of the most engaged audiences on the internet, TikTok Ads is a serious growth channel — especially if your app targets a younger demographic.

The secret sauce? **TikTok ads that don't look like ads perform best.** The platform rewards authentic, entertaining content. If you can make your app feel native to the TikTok experience, you can get incredible results at surprisingly low costs.

## What you'll learn

- Why TikTok works for app advertising
- How TikTok's ad platform compares to Meta and Google
- How to set up your account and tracking
- How to create your first campaign

## Why TikTok for app growth?

  <Card title="Engaged Audience" icon="heart">
    TikTok users spend an average of 95 minutes per day on the app. That's more attention than almost any other platform.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Young Demographics" icon="user">
    60%+ of users are under 35. If your app targets millennials or Gen Z, this is where they live.

  <Card title="Low CPMs" icon="dollar-sign">
    TikTok's ad inventory is still growing, which means impressions are cheaper than Meta or Google in many markets.

    TikTok's algorithm can make content (and ads) go viral. A great ad can outperform its budget dramatically.

## How TikTok compares

| | TikTok | Meta | Google |
|--|--------|------|--------|
| **Primary format** | Short-form video | Image + video | Text + image |
| **User mindset** | Entertainment | Social browsing | Searching |
| **Best creative** | Native, fun, authentic | Polished, benefit-focused | Clear, keyword-relevant |
| **Min. budget** | $20/day (campaign) | $5/day | $10/day |
| **CPI range** | $1-5 | $1-5 | $0.50-4 |
| **Audience** | Skews 18-35 | Broad (all ages) | Broad (all ages) |
| **Algorithm** | Very strong | Very strong | Strong (different) |

## The golden rule of TikTok Ads

<Note>
  **"Make TikToks, not ads."** This isn't just a TikTok marketing slogan — it's genuinely the best advice. Ads that look and feel like organic TikTok content outperform polished, traditional ads by 2-3x on this platform.
</Note>

### What this means in practice

- Film with a phone, not a studio
- Use trending sounds and formats
- Have a real person talking to camera
- Hook viewers in the first 1-2 seconds
- Keep it under 30 seconds (15 is ideal)
- Show your app naturally, like a recommendation from a friend

## Is TikTok right for your app?

TikTok works best for:

- **Consumer apps** — especially entertainment, social, lifestyle, fitness, and education
- **Visual apps** — apps that look interesting on screen
- **Apps with a young audience** — if your target user is 18-35
- **Apps with a "show-don't-tell" story** — before/after, transformation, tips

TikTok is harder for:

- **B2B or enterprise apps** — the audience isn't there (yet)
- **Complex technical products** — hard to explain in 15 seconds
- **Apps targeting 50+ demographics** — limited reach in that age group

## What to expect

| Timeline | What happens |
|----------|-------------|
| **Week 1** | Account setup, pixel installed, first campaign launched |
| **Week 2** | Algorithm learning, results inconsistent |
| **Week 3-4** | Performance stabilizes, you see what creative works |
| **Month 2+** | Scale winners, test new creative formats |

<Tip>
  **Budget tip:** TikTok's minimum campaign budget is $20/day ($50 total). Set aside at least $500 for your first month of testing. Less than that won't give the algorithm enough room to optimize.
