## Let's actually do this

You've got your account set up and tracking installed. Now it's time to create your first real campaign. We'll walk through every screen, every setting, and explain what each option means.

**Total time needed:** About 30-45 minutes for your first one.

## What you'll learn

- How to create a campaign with the right objective
- How to configure your ad set (audience, budget, schedule)
- How to create an ad with strong creative
- The settings to use (and the ones to skip for now)
- How to review and launch

## Before you start

Make sure you have these ready:

- [ ] Meta Ads Manager access (from account setup)
- [ ] Meta SDK or Pixel installed and verified
- [ ] At least one image or video for your ad (1080x1080 minimum)
- [ ] Ad copy written (headline + primary text + description)
- [ ] A budget in mind ($10-20/day is fine to start)

## Step-by-step walkthrough

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Ads Manager and click 'Create'">
    Navigate to [adsmanager.facebook.com](https://adsmanager.facebook.com) and click the green **+ Create** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your campaign objective">
    For app installs, select **App Promotion** (previously called "App Installs").

    Leave **Advantage Campaign Budget** turned ON — this lets Meta distribute your budget to the best-performing ad sets automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name your campaign">
    Use a naming convention you can scale. We recommend:
    ```
    [Goal] - [Audience] - [Date]
    Example: Installs - US Broad - 2026-02
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your ad set">
    This is where you define who sees your ad:

    **App:** Select your app from the dropdown

    **Optimization:** Choose "App Installs" (the default)

    **Budget:** Set $10-20/day to start

    **Schedule:** Start immediately, no end date (you'll pause manually)

    **Audience:**
    - Location: Start with one country (your primary market)
    - Age: Leave broad (18-65) unless you *know* your demographic
    - Interests: Add 3-5 relevant interests OR leave completely broad

    **Placements:** Choose **Advantage+ Placements** (let Meta decide where to show your ads)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your ad">
    **Format:** Single image or video (start simple)

    **Media:** Upload your image/video

    **Primary text:** 1-2 sentences about what your app does and why someone should try it

    **Headline:** Keep it under 5 words

    **Call to action:** "Install Now" for app install campaigns

    **Tracking:** Make sure your Meta Pixel/SDK is connected
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and publish">
    Click **Review** to check everything, then hit **Publish**.

    Your ad will enter Meta's review process (usually 15 minutes to a few hours).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Recommended first campaign settings

Here's a cheat sheet for your first campaign:

| Setting | Recommended value | Why |
|---------|------------------|-----|
| Objective | App Promotion | Direct app install goal |
| Budget | $15/day | Enough data without burning cash |
| Audience size | 1M-10M people | Broad enough for the algorithm |
| Placements | Advantage+ (automatic) | Let Meta find the best placements |
| Ad format | Single image or video | Simple to create and test |
| Duration | Run for 7 days minimum | Algorithm needs time to learn |

<Warning>
  **Don't touch your campaign for the first 3-4 days.** Meta's algorithm enters a "learning phase" where results fluctuate wildly. Editing your campaign during this period resets the learning phase. Just let it run.
</Warning>

## Writing ad copy that works

Your first ads don't need to be masterpieces. Here's a simple formula:

```
Primary text: [Pain point or desire] + [How your app helps] + [Social proof if you have it]
Headline: [Clear benefit in 3-5 words]
CTA: Install Now

Example:
Primary text: "Tired of forgetting tasks? TaskFlow keeps everything organized
  in one place. Join 50,000+ productive people."
Headline: "Never forget a task"
CTA: Install Now
```

<Tip>
  **Create 3-5 ad variations** in the same ad set. Use the same audience but different images/copy. Meta will automatically show the best-performing one more often. This is the easiest way to improve results.
</Tip>

## What happens after you launch

| Time | What to expect |
|------|---------------|
| **0-24 hours** | Ad in review, then starts delivering slowly |
| **1-3 days** | "Learning" phase — results are volatile, costs may be high |
| **4-7 days** | Results begin to stabilize |
| **7+ days** | You have enough data to make decisions |

## Your first-week checklist

After launch, check these things daily (but don't change anything yet):

- [ ] Is the campaign spending? (If not, check ad approval status)
- [ ] Are installs being tracked? (Check Events Manager)
- [ ] What's your CPI? (Don't panic if it's high in week 1)
- [ ] Which ad variations are performing best?
