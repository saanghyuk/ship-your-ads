## You Are About to Launch Your First Ad

This is the exciting part. You have set up your accounts, installed your tracking, and now it is time to actually create an ad that real people will see on Facebook and Instagram. We will walk through every single screen and every single setting together.

By the end of this guide, you will have a live ad campaign running on Meta's platform. Let us do this step by step.

<Tip>
Before you start, make sure you have the following ready: (1) your Meta Pixel is installed and verified, (2) a payment method is added to your ad account, (3) at least one image or video you want to use in your ad, and (4) a clear idea of what you want people to do after seeing your ad (install your app, visit your website, make a purchase, etc.).
</Tip>

## Understanding the Three Levels (Quick Refresher)

Remember from the Overview guide that Meta ads have three levels:

1. **Campaign** — Where you choose your goal (what do you want to achieve?)
2. **Ad Set** — Where you choose your audience, budget, and schedule (who sees it, how much do you spend?)
3. **Ad** — Where you create the actual content people see (what does the ad look like?)

You will configure all three levels in the process below. Meta walks you through them in order.

---

## Step 1: Open Ads Manager and Start a New Campaign

1. Open your web browser and go to **[adsmanager.facebook.com](https://adsmanager.facebook.com)**
2. Make sure you are in the correct ad account (check the dropdown at the top of the page)
3. Click the **green "+ Create" button** in the top-left area of the Campaigns tab
4. A new window will appear asking you to choose your campaign objective

---

## Step 2: Choose Your Campaign Objective

This is the most important decision in the entire setup. Your objective tells Meta what result you want, and Meta will optimize its entire algorithm to deliver that result.

You will see these objective options:

### For Your First Campaign, We Recommend:

- **If you want app installs:** Choose **App Promotion**
- **If you want website purchases:** Choose **Sales**
- **If you want website traffic:** Choose **Traffic**
- **If you want sign-ups/leads:** Choose **Leads**

For this walkthrough, we will use **Sales** as our example, since it is one of the most common objectives. The steps are very similar for other objectives.

5. Click on **Sales**
6. Click **Continue**

<Tip>
If you are not sure which objective to pick, ask yourself: "What is the ONE action I most want people to take after seeing my ad?" If the answer is "buy something," choose Sales. If it is "install my app," choose App Promotion. If it is "visit my website," choose Traffic. Do not overthink it — you can always create another campaign with a different objective later.
</Tip>

---

## Step 3: Configure Your Campaign Settings

You are now on the Campaign level. Here is what you will see and what to do:

### Campaign Name

7. Meta will auto-generate a name like "Sales campaign." **Change this** to something descriptive that will help you identify this campaign later. For example:
   - "US - Website Purchases - February 2026"
   - "App Install - iOS - First Test"
   - "Spring Sale - All Audiences"

### Special Ad Categories

8. Meta will ask if your ad falls into any special categories:
   - **Credit** — Ads for credit cards, loans, or financial services
   - **Employment** — Ads for job listings or job fairs
   - **Housing** — Ads for real estate or rentals
   - **Social issues, elections, or politics** — Ads about social or political topics

9. If your ad does NOT fall into any of these categories, leave them all unchecked and move on. If it does, check the appropriate box — this will limit some targeting options to comply with regulations.

### Advantage Campaign Budget (Optional)

10. You will see an option called **Advantage Campaign Budget** (previously called Campaign Budget Optimization or CBO)
11. If you turn this ON, Meta will automatically distribute your budget across all ad sets in this campaign, giving more budget to the best-performing ad sets
12. If you turn this OFF, you will set individual budgets for each ad set

**For your first campaign:** Turn this OFF. Setting individual budgets for each ad set gives you more control while you are learning.

### A/B Test (Optional)

13. You will see an option to create an A/B test
14. **For your first campaign:** Skip this. A/B testing is for later when you want to compare different strategies. Click **Next** to continue.

---

## Step 4: Configure Your Ad Set

You are now on the Ad Set level. This is where you define who sees your ad, how much you spend, and when your ad runs.

### Ad Set Name

15. Give your ad set a descriptive name. A good naming convention includes the audience and key settings:
   - "US 25-44 - Broad Interests - $20/day"
   - "Lookalike 1% - US - Daily Budget"

### Conversion Location

16. Choose where you want conversions to happen:
   - **Website** — If you want people to take actions on your website
   - **App** — If you want people to take actions in your app
   - **Website and App** — If you want both
   - **Messaging** — If you want people to message you
17. For this walkthrough, select **Website**

### Conversion Event (Performance Goal)

18. Choose what specific action you want to optimize for. This dropdown shows the events from your Meta Pixel:
   - **Purchase** — Optimize for people most likely to buy
   - **Add to Cart** — Optimize for people most likely to add items to cart
   - **Lead** — Optimize for people most likely to submit a form
   - **Complete Registration** — Optimize for people most likely to create an account

19. Select the event that matches your goal. If you want purchases, select **Purchase**.

<Tip>
Choose the event that represents the most valuable action for your business. If you want purchases but your Pixel is brand new and has very few purchase events, you might need to start with a higher-funnel event like "Add to Cart" first. Meta needs data to optimize, and it learns faster with more frequent events. Once you get about **50 conversions per week**, Meta's algorithm performs best.
</Tip>

---

## Step 5: Set Your Budget and Schedule

### Budget

20. Choose your budget type:
   - **Daily Budget** — Meta will spend approximately this amount every day (it may vary up to 25% on any given day but will average out over the week)
   - **Lifetime Budget** — Meta will spend this total amount over the entire campaign duration

21. **For your first campaign, choose Daily Budget**

22. Enter your daily budget amount:
   - Meta's minimum is **$5/day**
   - We recommend starting with **$10–$20/day** for your first campaign
   - This gives Meta enough budget to learn and find the right people
   - You can always increase or decrease this later

### Schedule

23. Choose when your campaign should run:
   - **Start date:** You can start immediately or choose a future date
   - **End date:** You can set an end date or let the campaign run indefinitely

24. **For your first campaign:** Start immediately and do NOT set an end date. You can pause the campaign manually at any time. Setting an end date limits Meta's ability to optimize.

<Tip>
Start with $10–$20/day and plan to let your campaign run for at least **7 days** before making any major decisions. Meta's algorithm needs time to learn who responds best to your ads. Making changes too early (like turning off the campaign after 2 days because you have not seen results yet) is the number one beginner mistake. Be patient.
</Tip>

## Step 6: Define Your Target Audience

This is where you tell Meta who should see your ad. You have several options:

### Option A: Advantage+ Audience (Recommended for Beginners)

25. Meta now offers **Advantage+ Audience**, which uses AI to automatically find the best audience for your ad. You can provide "audience suggestions" to guide the AI, but Meta will go beyond those suggestions if it finds better results.

26. If you choose Advantage+ Audience:
   - Enter **audience suggestions** like interests, demographics, or behaviors
   - Meta will use these as starting points but may expand beyond them
   - This is the simplest option and often performs very well

### Option B: Original Audience (Manual Targeting)

If you prefer more control, switch to original audience options:

27. **Locations:** Click **Edit** next to Locations
   - Type in the countries, states, cities, or zip codes you want to target
   - You can also exclude locations
   - For your first campaign, start with 1-2 countries where your primary audience lives

28. **Age:** Set the minimum and maximum age range
   - Think about who your product is for
   - If you are not sure, start broad (18-65) and let Meta's algorithm figure out who converts best

29. **Gender:** Choose All, Men, or Women
   - Unless your product is gender-specific, start with **All**

30. **Detailed Targeting:** This is where you can add interests, behaviors, and demographics
   - Click **Browse** to explore categories, or type keywords in the search box
   - Examples: "Online shopping," "Mobile app enthusiasts," "Fitness," "Technology"
   - Add 3-5 interests that are relevant to your product
   - Meta will show your ads to people who match ANY of the interests you add (not all of them)

31. **Languages:** Leave this blank unless your ad is in a specific language and you are targeting a multilingual country

<Tip>
For your first campaign, we recommend using **Advantage+ Audience** with a few audience suggestions. Meta's AI is remarkably good at finding the right people, and broad targeting often outperforms narrow targeting because it gives the algorithm more room to work. You can always test more specific audiences in future campaigns.
</Tip>

## Step 7: Choose Your Placements

Placements determine where your ad appears — Facebook Feed, Instagram Stories, Reels, etc.

32. You will see two options:
   - **Advantage+ Placements** (recommended) — Meta automatically shows your ad wherever it performs best
   - **Manual Placements** — You manually choose which platforms and placements to use

33. **For your first campaign:** Select **Advantage+ Placements**. Meta's algorithm is very good at distributing your ad across placements for the best results. Manually restricting placements limits the algorithm's ability to optimize.

### If You Choose Manual Placements:

34. You can select or deselect:
   - **Facebook:** Feed, Stories, Reels, In-stream video, Search, Right column, Marketplace
   - **Instagram:** Feed, Stories, Reels, Explore
   - **Messenger:** Inbox, Stories
   - **Audience Network:** Native, banner, interstitial, rewarded video

35. For each placement, you can preview how your ad will look

---

## Step 8: Click "Next" to Move to the Ad Level

36. Review all your ad set settings one final time
37. Click **Next** to move to the Ad creation level

---

## Step 9: Create Your Ad

Now for the creative part — designing the actual ad that people will see.

### Ad Name

38. Give your ad a descriptive name:
   - "Video - Product Demo - V1"
   - "Image - Lifestyle Shot - CTA Download"
   - "Carousel - 3 Features"

### Identity (Which Page the Ad Comes From)

39. Select your **Facebook Page** from the dropdown — this is the page name that will appear on your ad
40. Select your **Instagram account** if you connected one (optional but recommended)

### Ad Setup

41. Choose how to create your ad:
   - **Create Ad** — Build a new ad from scratch (select this)
   - **Use Existing Post** — Promote a post you already published on your Page
   - **Use Creative Hub Mockup** — Use a mockup you created in Creative Hub

42. Select **Create Ad**

### Ad Format

43. Choose your ad format:
   - **Single Image or Video** — One image or one video. The simplest and most common format.
   - **Carousel** — Multiple scrollable images or videos, each with its own link
   - **Collection** — A cover image/video with product images below (best for e-commerce)

44. **For your first ad:** Select **Single Image or Video**

<Tip>
Start with a single image ad for your very first campaign. It is the simplest format to create and test. Once you see initial results and understand how the system works, you can experiment with video, carousel, and other formats in future campaigns. Many top-performing ads are actually simple, well-designed single images.
</Tip>

---

## Step 10: Add Your Creative (Image or Video)

### Adding an Image:

45. Click **Add Media** → **Add Image**
46. You can:
   - **Upload** a new image from your computer
   - **Browse** images from your Page or Instagram
   - Use **free stock images** from Meta's built-in library
47. Select or upload your image
48. Click **Next** or **Done**

### Image Best Practices:

- **Recommended size:** 1080 x 1080 pixels (square) for Feed, or 1080 x 1920 pixels (vertical 9:16) for Stories/Reels
- **File type:** JPG or PNG
- **Keep text minimal on the image** — Meta's algorithm tends to favor images with little to no text overlay
- **Use bright, eye-catching colors** that stand out in the feed
- **Show your product or app in action** — people scroll quickly, so your image needs to grab attention instantly

### Adding a Video:

45. Click **Add Media** → **Add Video**
46. Upload a video from your computer or choose from existing videos
47. Meta accepts most common video formats (MP4 is best)
48. Video recommendations:
   - Keep it under 30 seconds (15 seconds is ideal for most placements)
   - Vertical (9:16) for Stories and Reels
   - Square (1:1) for Feed
   - Start with something attention-grabbing in the first 3 seconds
   - Add captions — most people watch with sound off

---

## Step 11: Write Your Ad Copy

This is where you write the text that accompanies your image or video.

### Primary Text (Main Body Copy)

49. Write the main text that appears above your image/video. This is where you make your pitch.

**Tips for writing great primary text:**
- Start with a hook that grabs attention (a question, a bold statement, or a problem your audience has)
- Keep the first sentence short and impactful
- Explain the benefit of your product (focus on what it does for the customer, not features)
- Include a clear call to action
- Keep it under 125 characters to avoid the "See More" truncation (though longer copy can work too)

**Example:**
```

```

### Headline

50. Write a short, punchy headline that appears below your image/video (usually in bold).
- Keep it under 40 characters
- Make it action-oriented
- Focus on the key benefit

**Examples:**
- "Build Better Habits in 5 Minutes/Day"
- "Free Habit Tracker - Download Now"
- "Your Best Self Starts Here"

### Description

51. Write a short description that appears below the headline (not always visible on all placements).
- This is optional but recommended
- Keep it under 30 characters
- Add extra context or a secondary benefit

**Example:**
- "Rated 4.8 stars by 10,000+ users"
- "No credit card required"

<Tip>
The headline and primary text are the two most impactful text elements. Spend 80% of your copywriting time on these. A great headline paired with a compelling first sentence of primary text can dramatically improve your ad's performance. When in doubt, lead with the biggest benefit your product offers.
</Tip>

---

## Step 12: Add Your Call to Action and Destination

### Call-to-Action Button

52. Select a **call-to-action (CTA) button** from the dropdown. Options include:
   - **Shop Now** — For e-commerce/purchases
   - **Learn More** — For informational/educational offers
   - **Sign Up** — For registration/email collection
   - **Download** — For app installs
   - **Get Offer** — For promotions/discounts
   - **Book Now** — For services/appointments

53. Choose the CTA that best matches what you want people to do

### Website URL (Destination)

54. Enter the **URL** where people will go when they click your ad:
   - Your product page
   - Your app store listing
   - Your landing page
   - Your sign-up page

55. Make sure the URL works correctly — click it yourself to test

### URL Parameters (Optional)

56. You can add **URL parameters** to track where traffic comes from:
   - Click **Build a URL Parameter**
   - Add UTM parameters like `utm_source=meta&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign=first_campaign`
   - This helps you track Meta ad traffic in Google Analytics or other analytics tools

---

## Step 13: Preview Your Ad

Before publishing, preview how your ad will look across different placements.

57. On the right side of the screen, you will see an **ad preview panel**
58. Click through different placements to see how your ad looks:
   - Facebook Feed (mobile)
   - Facebook Feed (desktop)
   - Instagram Feed
   - Instagram Stories
   - Facebook Stories
   - Reels
59. Check that:
   - Your image/video looks good and is not cropped awkwardly
   - Your text is readable and not cut off
   - Your headline makes sense
   - The CTA button is appropriate

<Tip>
Pay special attention to the **mobile preview**. Over 98% of Meta's users access the platform on mobile devices. If your ad looks great on desktop but the text is cut off or the image is cropped poorly on mobile, you need to fix it. Mobile is where your ad will actually be seen.
</Tip>

---

## Step 14: Review and Publish

60. Click the **Publish** button (green button at the bottom right)
61. Meta will show you a **review summary** with all your campaign settings:
   - Campaign objective
   - Budget and schedule
   - Audience targeting
   - Ad creative and copy
62. Review everything one final time
63. If everything looks good, click **Publish** to confirm

### What Happens After You Publish:

64. Your campaign status will change to **"In Review"**
65. Meta reviews every ad to make sure it complies with their advertising policies
66. This review process usually takes **less than 24 hours** (often just a few hours)
67. Once approved, your ad status will change to **"Active"** and it will start showing to people
68. If your ad is rejected, Meta will tell you why, and you can edit and resubmit it

<Tip>
Meta's ad review usually completes within **24 hours**, but most ads are reviewed much faster — often within 1-2 hours. If your ad has not been reviewed after 24 hours, try duplicating it and submitting the duplicate. Occasionally ads get stuck in the review queue, and creating a fresh copy resolves the issue.
</Tip>

---

## Step 15: What to Expect in the First 48 Hours

### The Learning Phase

After your ad is approved and starts running, Meta enters the **learning phase**. Here is what to expect:

- **Hours 1-6:** You may see very few impressions and results. This is normal. Meta is just getting started.
- **Hours 6-24:** Results will start trickling in, but they may be inconsistent. Some hours will look great, others will look terrible.
- **Hours 24-48:** Results should start to stabilize. You will begin to see patterns in who is responding to your ad.
- **Days 3-7:** The algorithm gets progressively smarter. Results should improve each day.

### What NOT to Do:

- **Do not turn off your campaign after 24 hours** because results look bad. Give it at least 5-7 days.
- **Do not change your budget, audience, or creative** during the first 3-5 days. Changes reset the learning phase.
- **Do not panic** if your cost per result seems high at first. It almost always comes down as the algorithm learns.

### Key Metrics to Watch:

- **Impressions:** How many times your ad was shown
- **Reach:** How many unique people saw your ad
- **Clicks:** How many people clicked on your ad
- **CTR (Click-Through Rate):** The percentage of people who saw your ad and clicked (good CTR is 1-3% for most industries)
- **CPC (Cost Per Click):** How much each click costs
- **Conversions:** How many people took your desired action (purchase, sign-up, etc.)
- **Cost Per Result:** How much each conversion costs — this is your most important metric

---

## Troubleshooting Common First-Campaign Issues

### "My ad was rejected"

**Common rejection reasons:**
- Your ad mentions personal attributes ("Are you overweight?" is not allowed)
- Your image has too much text
- Your landing page does not match what the ad promises
- Your product is in a restricted category
- The image or video violates community standards

**What to do:**
1. Read the rejection reason carefully
2. Fix the issue in your ad
3. Resubmit for review

### "My ad is approved but getting zero impressions"

**Possible causes:**
- Your audience is too narrow
- Your budget is too low
- Your bid is not competitive
- There is an issue with your payment method

**What to do:**
1. Check that your payment method is valid
2. Try broadening your audience
3. Increase your budget slightly
4. Check that your ad set is not paused

### "I am getting clicks but no conversions"

**Possible causes:**
- Your Pixel is not firing correctly on the conversion page
- Your landing page does not match the ad's promise
- Your checkout or sign-up process has friction
- You need more time (some products have longer consideration periods)

**What to do:**
1. Verify your Pixel is working with the Meta Pixel Helper
2. Test your entire conversion flow yourself
3. Make sure your landing page is fast and mobile-friendly
4. Wait at least 5-7 days before drawing conclusions

## What Comes Next

Congratulations — you have launched your first Meta ad campaign. This is a significant milestone. Give your campaign at least 5-7 days to gather data, and resist the urge to make changes during this initial period.

In the **Audiences** guide, we will dive deep into Custom Audiences, Lookalike Audiences, and advanced targeting strategies that you can use in your next campaigns. These audience tools are incredibly powerful and can dramatically improve your results.

<Tip>
Set a reminder on your calendar for 7 days from now to review your campaign results. When that day comes, look at your cost per result (the most important metric) and compare it to what you are willing to pay for each conversion. If it is profitable, consider increasing the budget. If it is too expensive, the Optimization guide will show you how to improve it.
</Tip>
