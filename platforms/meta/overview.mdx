## Why Meta?

If you only run ads on one platform, make it Meta. With over 3 billion monthly users across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, Meta gives you the biggest audience and the most sophisticated ad algorithm in the game.

But the real reason developers love Meta? **The algorithm is scary good at finding users who'll actually use your app.** You give it a goal ("find people who'll install my app"), show it some creative, and it does the rest.

## What you'll learn

In this section, you'll go from zero to running profitable Meta campaigns:

- Why Meta's ad platform is uniquely powerful for app growth
- How to set up your Business Manager and ad account
- How to install the Meta Pixel and SDK for tracking
- How to create and launch your first campaign
- How to build powerful audiences (custom, lookalike, and saved)
- How to optimize campaigns once they're live

## How Meta Ads work (the 30-second version)

```
You set a goal (app installs)
    → Meta finds users likely to install
        → Users see your ad in their feed/stories
            → They click, install, and you pay per result
```

Meta's algorithm uses **machine learning** to figure out which users are most likely to take your desired action. The more data it gets, the smarter it becomes. This is why tracking setup is so important — garbage data in, garbage results out.

## What to expect as a beginner

Let's set realistic expectations:

| Timeline | What happens |
|----------|-------------|
| **Week 1** | Account setup, pixel/SDK installed, first campaign launched |
| **Week 2-3** | Algorithm is "learning" — results will be inconsistent |
| **Week 4+** | Data stabilizes, you can start optimizing |
| **Month 2+** | You understand what works and can scale |

<Note>
  Meta's algorithm needs about **50 conversions per week per ad set** to fully optimize. If your budget is small, that's okay — just know that results will take longer to stabilize.
</Note>

## Typical costs for app installs

These are rough ranges — your actual costs depend on your app category, targeting, and creative quality:

| App Category | CPI (Cost Per Install) |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Games | $1.50 - $5.00 |
| E-commerce | $2.00 - $6.00 |
| Fitness/Health | $2.50 - $7.00 |
| Finance | $3.00 - $10.00 |
| Social | $1.00 - $4.00 |

<Tip>
  Don't obsess over CPI alone. A $5 install that generates $20 in revenue is way better than a $1 install that never opens the app again. **Focus on the quality of users, not just the cost.**
</Tip>
