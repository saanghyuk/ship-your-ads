## Why tracking matters

Without tracking, running ads is like throwing money into a black hole. You won't know which ads drive installs, which users are valuable, or how to improve. **Tracking is non-negotiable.**

Meta uses two main tracking tools:

- **Meta Pixel** — for websites and landing pages
- **Meta SDK** — for mobile apps

If you're running app install ads, you need the SDK. If you're sending traffic to a website first, you need the Pixel too.

## What you'll learn

- The difference between the Meta Pixel and Meta SDK
- How to install the Meta SDK in your iOS and Android app
- How to set up key events (install, purchase, sign-up, etc.)
- How to verify your tracking is working correctly
- How to handle iOS 14+ privacy changes (ATT framework)

## Which one do you need?

| Scenario | What to install |
|----------|----------------|
| App install ads (direct to store) | Meta SDK only |
| Website/landing page → app store | Meta Pixel + Meta SDK |
| Web app (no mobile app) | Meta Pixel only |

<Tip>
  **Most app developers need the Meta SDK.** If you also have a landing page or website, add the Pixel there too. The more data Meta has, the better it optimizes.
</Tip>

## Installing the Meta SDK

### For iOS (Swift)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the SDK via Swift Package Manager">
    In Xcode, go to **File** > **Add Packages** and add:
    ```
    https://github.com/facebook/facebook-ios-sdk
    ```
    Select the `FacebookCore` package at minimum.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your Info.plist">
    Add your Facebook App ID and Client Token to your `Info.plist`:
    ```xml
    <key>FacebookAppID</key>
    <string>YOUR_APP_ID</string>
    <key>FacebookClientToken</key>
    <string>YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN</string>
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize in AppDelegate">
    ```swift
    import FacebookCore

    func application(_ application: UIApplication,
        didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        ApplicationDelegate.shared.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
        return true
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### For Android (Kotlin)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the SDK dependency">
    In your app-level `build.gradle`:
    ```groovy
    implementation 'com.facebook.android:facebook-android-sdk:latest.release'
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure AndroidManifest.xml">
    ```xml
    <meta-data
        android:name="com.facebook.sdk.ApplicationId"
        android:value="@string/facebook_app_id"/>
    <meta-data
        android:name="com.facebook.sdk.ClientToken"
        android:value="@string/facebook_client_token"/>
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize the SDK">
    ```kotlin
    import com.facebook.FacebookSdk

    class MyApplication : Application() {
        override fun onCreate() {
            super.onCreate()
            FacebookSdk.sdkInitialize(applicationContext)
        }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting up key events

Meta tracks **standard events** that help it optimize your campaigns. Here are the most important ones:

| Event | When to fire it | Why it matters |
|-------|----------------|---------------|
| `Install` | Automatic with SDK | Tracks new installs |
| `CompleteRegistration` | User signs up | Tracks activation |
| `Purchase` | User makes a purchase | Tracks revenue |
| `AddToCart` | User adds item to cart | Tracks purchase intent |
| `ViewContent` | User views key content | Tracks engagement |

<Note>
  The **Install** event fires automatically when you install the SDK. You don't need to code it manually. For other events, you'll need to add event logging calls in your app code.
</Note>

## Handling iOS 14+ (App Tracking Transparency)

Since iOS 14.5, Apple requires apps to ask permission before tracking. This is the ATT (App Tracking Transparency) prompt.

**You must implement ATT** or Meta will have very limited data on iOS users:

```swift
import AppTrackingTransparency

func requestTrackingPermission() {
    ATTrackingManager.requestTrackingAuthorization { status in
        // Meta SDK automatically uses this status
    }
}
```

<Warning>
  Show the ATT prompt at a moment that makes sense — not immediately on first launch. Users who understand *why* you're asking are more likely to allow tracking. Consider showing it after they've experienced value in your app.
</Warning>

## Verifying your setup

After installing the SDK, verify everything works:

1. **Events Manager** — Go to Meta Events Manager and check that events are flowing in
2. **Test Events tool** — Use the Test Events tab to send test events from your device
3. **SDK Diagnostics** — Check for any warnings or errors in the diagnostics tab

Your tracking is working when you see events appearing in Events Manager within a few minutes of triggering them in your app.

## Installing the Meta Pixel (for websites)

If you have a landing page or website, add the Pixel too:

```html
<!-- Meta Pixel Code -->
<script>
  !function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s)
  {if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod?
  n.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)};
  if(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n;n.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version='2.0';
  n.queue=[];t=b.createElement(e);t.async=!0;
  t.src=v;s=b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0];
  s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}(window, document,'script',
  'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/fbevents.js');
  fbq('init', 'YOUR_PIXEL_ID');
  fbq('track', 'PageView');
</script>
```
