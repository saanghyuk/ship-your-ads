## Why Tracking Matters More Than Anything

Imagine running a lemonade stand but having no idea how many cups you sold, who your customers were, or whether your "Buy 1 Get 1 Free" sign actually worked. That is what running Meta ads without tracking is like — you are spending money with no way to know what is working.

Meta Pixel and the Conversions API are your measurement tools. They tell Meta exactly what happens after someone clicks your ad. Did they sign up? Did they make a purchase? Did they browse three pages and leave? This data is absolutely essential for two reasons:

1. **You can measure your return on investment.** Without tracking, you literally cannot tell if your ads are profitable or not.
2. **Meta's algorithm uses this data to improve.** When Meta knows which ad clicks lead to purchases, it gets dramatically better at finding more people who will purchase. Without this data, Meta is flying blind.

This guide will walk you through every step of setting up both Meta Pixel and the Conversions API. We will start with what they are, then move to installation, then verify everything is working.

<Tip>
Setting up tracking correctly from the very beginning is the single most impactful thing you can do for your ad campaigns. Many advertisers skip this step or do it incorrectly, and then wonder why their campaigns are not performing well. Take your time with this guide — it is worth it.

## What Is Meta Pixel?

Meta Pixel (previously known as Facebook Pixel — Meta renamed it when they rebranded the company) is a small piece of JavaScript code that you place on your website. It looks like this:

```html
<!-- Meta Pixel Code -->
<script>
  !function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s)
  {if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod?
  n.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)};
  if(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n;n.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version='2.0';
  n.queue=[];t=b.createElement(e);t.async=!0;
  t.src=v;s=b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0];
  s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}(window, document,'script',
  'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/fbevents.js');
  fbq('init', 'YOUR_PIXEL_ID');
  fbq('track', 'PageView');
</script>
<noscript><img height="1" width="1" style="display:none"
  src="https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=YOUR_PIXEL_ID&ev=PageView&noscript=1"
/></noscript>
<!-- End Meta Pixel Code -->
```

When someone visits your website, this code runs in their browser and sends information back to Meta. Here is what it does:

- **Tracks page views** — Meta knows which pages on your site people visit
- **Tracks events** — You can tell Meta when specific things happen (like a purchase, sign-up, or add-to-cart)
- **Identifies users** — Meta matches website visitors with Facebook/Instagram users, so it knows which ad led to which action
- **Builds audiences** — You can create Custom Audiences of people who visited specific pages or took specific actions

### How the Pixel Works (Simple Explanation)

1. Someone sees your ad on Facebook or Instagram
2. They click on the ad and land on your website
3. The Meta Pixel code fires in their browser
4. The Pixel sends data back to Meta: "This person visited this page"
5. If the person completes an action (like a purchase), the Pixel sends that too
6. Meta connects the dots: "This ad click led to this purchase"

---

## What Is the Conversions API (CAPI)?

The Conversions API is the server-side complement to Meta Pixel. While the Pixel runs in the user's browser (client-side), CAPI sends data directly from your server to Meta's servers.

### Why Do You Need Both?

Browser-based tracking (like Meta Pixel) is becoming less reliable because:

- **Ad blockers** block tracking pixels for many users
- **Safari's Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP)** limits cookie lifetimes and blocks cross-site tracking
- **Firefox Enhanced Tracking Protection** blocks many tracking scripts
- **Privacy regulations** (GDPR, CCPA) require user consent before tracking

The Conversions API solves these problems by sending data from your server, which ad blockers and browser restrictions cannot touch. Meta strongly recommends using both the Pixel and CAPI together for the most complete and accurate data.

Think of it like this:
- **Meta Pixel** = A camera at the front door of your store (some people can dodge it)
- **Conversions API** = A receipt printer at the register (captures every transaction no matter what)

Using both together gives you the most complete picture.

<Tip>
Meta estimates that advertisers who use both Pixel and Conversions API together see, on average, a **13% improvement in cost per action** compared to using Pixel alone. This is because Meta's algorithm has more and better data to work with, so it makes smarter decisions about who to show your ads to.
</Tip>

## Step 1: Create Your Meta Pixel

Before you can install anything, you need to create a Pixel in your Meta Business Suite.

### How to Create Your Pixel:

1. Go to **[business.facebook.com](https://business.facebook.com)** and log in
2. Click the **hamburger menu** (three horizontal lines) in the top-left corner, or navigate through the left sidebar
3. Look for **Events Manager** — you can find it under "All Tools" or by searching for it in the search bar at the top
4. Click on **Events Manager**
5. You will see a page with your data sources. If this is your first time, it may prompt you to get started
6. Click **Connect Data Sources** (the green button)
7. Select **Web** as the data source type
8. Click **Connect**
9. Enter a **name** for your Pixel — use something descriptive like "My App Name - Website Pixel"
10. Enter your **website URL** — this is the URL of the website where you will install the Pixel
11. Click **Continue**

### Your Pixel ID:

After creating your Pixel, you will be given a **Pixel ID** — a unique number that looks something like `123456789012345`. This is the ID you will use in your Pixel code. Write this number down or copy it to a safe place. You will need it in the next steps.

12. You can find your Pixel ID at any time by going to Events Manager and looking at the top of the page next to your Pixel name

---

## Step 2: Install Meta Pixel on Your Website

There are several ways to install Meta Pixel. We will cover the most common methods.

### Method A: Manual Installation (Adding Code Directly)

This method works for any website. You copy the Pixel code and paste it into your website's HTML.

1. In Events Manager, click on your Pixel
2. Click **Continue Pixel Setup** or **Add Events** → **From a New Website**
3. Select **Install code manually**
4. Meta will show you the Pixel base code (it looks like the code shown earlier in this guide)
5. **Copy the entire code snippet**

Now you need to paste this code into every page of your website:

6. Open your website's HTML files (or your template/theme editor)
7. Find the `<head>` section — this is near the top of your HTML, between `<head>` and `</head>` tags
8. **Paste the Pixel code** just before the closing `</head>` tag
9. Save the file
10. Repeat for every page on your website (or if you use a template system, add it to your main template/layout file so it automatically appears on every page)

```html
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Website</title>
  <!-- Other head content like CSS, meta tags, etc. -->

  <!-- Meta Pixel Code - Paste it here, before </head> -->
  <script>
    !function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s)
    {if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod?
    n.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)};
    if(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n;n.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version='2.0';
    n.queue=[];t=b.createElement(e);t.async=!0;
    t.src=v;s=b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0];
    s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}(window, document,'script',
    'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/fbevents.js');
    fbq('init', 'YOUR_PIXEL_ID_HERE');
    fbq('track', 'PageView');
  </script>
  <noscript><img height="1" width="1" style="display:none"
    src="https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=YOUR_PIXEL_ID_HERE&ev=PageView&noscript=1"
  /></noscript>
  <!-- End Meta Pixel Code -->
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Your website content -->
</body>
</html>
```

<Tip>
Replace `YOUR_PIXEL_ID_HERE` with your actual Pixel ID (the number you copied in Step 1). If you forget to replace this placeholder, the Pixel will not work. This is the most common installation mistake we see.
</Tip>

### Method B: Using Google Tag Manager (GTM)

If your website uses Google Tag Manager, you can install the Pixel through GTM without touching your website code directly.

1. Log into **[tagmanager.google.com](https://tagmanager.google.com)**
2. Select your website's container
3. Click **Tags** in the left sidebar
4. Click **New**
5. Click **Tag Configuration**
6. Select **Custom HTML**
7. Paste the Meta Pixel base code (the same code from Method A) into the HTML field
8. Click **Triggering**
9. Select **All Pages** (this makes the Pixel fire on every page)
10. Give your tag a name like "Meta Pixel - Base Code"
11. Click **Save**
12. Click **Submit** in the top-right corner
13. Add a version name like "Added Meta Pixel" and click **Publish**

### Method C: Using a CMS Plugin (WordPress, Shopify, etc.)

Many popular website platforms have built-in integrations or plugins for Meta Pixel.

**For WordPress:**

1. Install the **"Meta Pixel for WordPress"** plugin (official plugin from Meta)
2. Go to **Settings → Meta Pixel** in your WordPress dashboard
3. Enter your **Pixel ID**
4. Click **Save Changes**
5. The plugin automatically adds the Pixel code to every page

**For Shopify:**

1. In your Shopify admin, go to **Online Store → Preferences**
2. Scroll down to the **Meta Pixel** section (previously called Facebook Pixel)
3. Click **Set up Meta Pixel**
4. Follow the prompts to connect your Meta Business Suite
5. Select your Pixel from the list
6. Click **Connect**
7. Shopify automatically handles the Pixel installation

**For Next.js / React:**

If you are building a web app with Next.js or React, you can add the Pixel to your main layout or `_app` component:

```jsx
// pages/_app.js (Next.js) or your main App component
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import Script from 'next/script';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <>
      {/* Meta Pixel */}
      <Script
        id="meta-pixel"
        strategy="afterInteractive"
        dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
          __html: `
            !function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s)
            {if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod?
            n.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)};
            if(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n;n.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version='2.0';
            n.queue=[];t=b.createElement(e);t.async=!0;
            t.src=v;s=b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0];
            s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}(window, document,'script',
            'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/fbevents.js');
            fbq('init', 'YOUR_PIXEL_ID_HERE');
            fbq('track', 'PageView');
          `,
        }}
      />
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

<Tip>
If you are using a modern JavaScript framework like Next.js or React, make sure the Pixel loads **after** the page is interactive (using `afterInteractive` strategy in Next.js or loading it in `useEffect` in React). Loading it too early can slow down your page, and loading it too late can miss page views.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Set Up Standard Events

The base Pixel code only tracks page views. To track specific actions (like purchases, sign-ups, or add-to-cart), you need to set up **events**.

Meta has a set of **standard events** — predefined event names that Meta's algorithm understands and can optimize for.

### Most Important Standard Events:

| Event Name | When to Use It | Code |
|---|---|---|
| `PageView` | Every page load (already in base code) | `fbq('track', 'PageView');` |
| `Lead` | When someone submits a form or signs up | `fbq('track', 'Lead');` |
| `CompleteRegistration` | When someone finishes creating an account | `fbq('track', 'CompleteRegistration');` |
| `AddToCart` | When someone adds a product to their cart | `fbq('track', 'AddToCart');` |
| `InitiateCheckout` | When someone starts the checkout process | `fbq('track', 'InitiateCheckout');` |
| `Purchase` | When someone completes a purchase | `fbq('track', 'Purchase', {value: 9.99, currency: 'USD'});` |
| `ViewContent` | When someone views a product or content page | `fbq('track', 'ViewContent');` |
| `Search` | When someone uses your search feature | `fbq('track', 'Search');` |
| `AddPaymentInfo` | When someone adds payment information | `fbq('track', 'AddPaymentInfo');` |
| `Subscribe` | When someone subscribes to a service | `fbq('track', 'Subscribe', {value: 4.99, currency: 'USD'});` |

### How to Add Standard Events to Your Website:

You add event tracking code to the specific pages or buttons where the action happens. Here are examples:

**Tracking a Purchase (on your "Thank You" or confirmation page):**

```html
<script>
  fbq('track', 'Purchase', {
    value: 29.99,
    currency: 'USD',
    content_type: 'product',
    content_ids: ['product_123']
  });
</script>
```

**Tracking a Sign-Up (when the registration form is submitted):**

```html
<script>
  // Call this when the form is successfully submitted
  fbq('track', 'CompleteRegistration', {
    content_name: 'Free Trial',
    status: true
  });
</script>
```

**Tracking an Add-to-Cart (when the "Add to Cart" button is clicked):**

```javascript
// Add this to your "Add to Cart" button's click handler
document.getElementById('add-to-cart-button').addEventListener('click', function() {
  fbq('track', 'AddToCart', {
    value: 19.99,
    currency: 'USD',
    content_ids: ['product_456'],
    content_type: 'product'
  });
});
```

<Tip>
Always include the `value` and `currency` parameters for Purchase events. Without these, Meta cannot calculate your return on ad spend (ROAS), which is one of the most important metrics for understanding whether your ads are profitable.
</Tip>

---

## Step 4: Set Up the Conversions API (CAPI)

Now let us set up the server-side tracking. The Conversions API sends event data directly from your server to Meta, making it resistant to ad blockers and browser restrictions.

### Understanding How CAPI Works:

1. A user takes an action on your website (like making a purchase)
2. Your server processes that action
3. Your server sends the event data directly to Meta's API
4. Meta receives data from both the Pixel (browser) and CAPI (server)
5. Meta deduplicates the data (so it is not counted twice) using an event ID

### Method A: Using Meta's Partner Integrations

The easiest way to set up CAPI is through a partner integration. Meta has built-in integrations with many platforms:

**For Shopify:**

1. In Events Manager, click on your Pixel
2. Click **Settings**
3. Scroll down to **Conversions API**
4. Click **Set Up Through a Partner Integration**
5. Select **Shopify**
6. Follow the prompts to connect your Shopify store
7. Shopify will automatically set up both Pixel and CAPI

**For WordPress (using a plugin):**

1. Install the **"Meta for WordPress"** plugin (official)
2. Go to **Settings → Meta**
3. Click **Get Started** and connect your Meta Business Suite
4. The plugin will set up both Pixel and CAPI automatically

### Method B: Manual CAPI Setup (For Developers)

If you are building a custom website or app, you will need to implement CAPI in your server code.

**Step 1: Generate an Access Token**

1. Go to Events Manager and click on your Pixel
2. Click **Settings**
3. Scroll down to **Conversions API**
4. Click **Generate Access Token**
5. Copy the access token — you will need this in your server code

**Step 2: Send Events from Your Server**

Here is an example of sending a Purchase event via CAPI using Node.js:

```javascript
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
const crypto = require('crypto');

async function sendConversionEvent(eventData) {
  const pixelId = 'YOUR_PIXEL_ID';
  const accessToken = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN';

  const url = `https://graph.facebook.com/v18.0/${pixelId}/events`;

  const payload = {
    data: [{
      event_name: 'Purchase',
      event_time: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
      event_id: eventData.eventId, // For deduplication with Pixel
      action_source: 'website',
      event_source_url: eventData.pageUrl,
      user_data: {
        em: [hashSHA256(eventData.email)], // Hashed email
        ph: [hashSHA256(eventData.phone)], // Hashed phone
        client_ip_address: eventData.ipAddress,
        client_user_agent: eventData.userAgent,
        fbc: eventData.fbc, // Facebook click ID from cookie
        fbp: eventData.fbp, // Facebook browser ID from cookie
      },
      custom_data: {
        value: eventData.purchaseValue,
        currency: 'USD',
        content_ids: eventData.productIds,
        content_type: 'product',
      }
    }],
    access_token: accessToken,
  };

  const response = await fetch(url, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(payload),
  });

  const result = await response.json();
  return result;
}

function hashSHA256(value) {
  return crypto.createHash('sha256').update(value.toLowerCase().trim()).digest('hex');
}
```

**Step 3: Implement Event Deduplication**

When you use both Pixel and CAPI, the same event might be sent twice (once from the browser, once from the server). Meta uses **event deduplication** to prevent double-counting. To make this work:

1. Generate a unique **event ID** for each event (e.g., a UUID)
2. Include this event ID in BOTH the Pixel event AND the CAPI event
3. Meta will match events with the same event ID and count them only once

Browser-side (Pixel):
```javascript
const eventId = generateUUID(); // Your function to create a unique ID

fbq('track', 'Purchase', {
  value: 29.99,
  currency: 'USD'
}, { eventID: eventId });

// Also send eventId to your server so it can include it in the CAPI call
```

Server-side (CAPI):
```javascript
// Use the same eventId received from the browser
const payload = {
  data: [{
    event_name: 'Purchase',
    event_id: eventId, // Same ID as the Pixel event
    // ... rest of the event data
  }]
};
```

<Tip>
Event deduplication is critical. Without it, Meta will count every event twice — once from the Pixel and once from CAPI — which will mess up your conversion counts and confuse the algorithm. Always use the same event ID in both your Pixel events and CAPI events.
</Tip>

## Step 5: Set Up Custom Conversions (Optional)

Custom conversions let you track specific actions based on URL rules, without adding any additional code to your website. This is useful if you cannot modify your website code easily.

### How to Create a Custom Conversion:

1. Go to **Events Manager**
2. Click **Custom Conversions** in the left sidebar
3. Click **Create Custom Conversion**
4. Give it a **name** (like "Completed Purchase" or "Signed Up for Trial")
5. Set the **rule** — for example:
   - URL contains "thank-you" (for a thank-you page after purchase)
   - URL contains "registration-complete" (for a registration confirmation page)
   - URL equals "https://yoursite.com/success" (for a specific success page)
6. Choose the **category** (Purchase, Lead, Complete Registration, etc.)
7. Optionally set a **conversion value** (how much each conversion is worth)
8. Click **Create**

### When to Use Custom Conversions vs. Standard Events:

- **Use Standard Events** when you can add code to your website. They give you more control and better data.
- **Use Custom Conversions** when you cannot modify your website code, or as a quick-and-dirty setup while you work on implementing proper standard events.

## Step 6: Verify Your Pixel Is Working

After installation, you MUST verify that your Pixel is actually working. Here is how.

### Method 1: Meta Pixel Helper (Chrome Extension)

This is the easiest and most reliable way to check your Pixel.

1. Open the **Chrome Web Store** ([chrome.google.com/webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore))
2. Search for **"Meta Pixel Helper"**
3. Click **Add to Chrome** to install the extension
4. Navigate to your website in Chrome
5. Click the **Meta Pixel Helper icon** in your browser toolbar (it looks like a small `</>` icon)
6. The extension will tell you:
   - Whether a Pixel was found on the page
   - Your Pixel ID
   - What events fired (you should see at least a "PageView" event)
   - Any errors or warnings

**What you want to see:**
- A green checkmark next to your Pixel ID
- "PageView" event firing on every page
- Additional events firing on the correct pages (like "Purchase" on your confirmation page)

**Common issues:**
- "No Pixel found" — The code is not on the page, or it is not loading correctly
- "Pixel found but not firing" — The code is on the page but something is preventing it from running (could be a JavaScript error)
- Wrong Pixel ID — Double-check that the ID in your code matches the one in Events Manager

### Method 2: Test Events in Events Manager

Meta provides a built-in testing tool in Events Manager.

1. Go to **Events Manager**
2. Click on your Pixel
3. Click the **Test Events** tab
4. Enter your **website URL** in the "Test browser events" field
5. Click **Open Website**
6. Your website will open in a new tab
7. Browse around your website — visit different pages, click buttons, make a test purchase
8. Go back to the Events Manager tab
9. You should see events appearing in real time as you browse your website

<Tip>
After installing your Pixel, wait about **20 minutes** before checking Events Manager for data. While the Meta Pixel Helper extension shows results instantly, Events Manager can take a short time to process and display incoming events. If you do not see data after 20 minutes, there is likely an installation issue.
</Tip>

### Method 3: Check Events Manager Overview

After your Pixel has been running for a few hours:

1. Go to **Events Manager**
2. Click on your Pixel
3. Click the **Overview** tab
4. You should see a graph showing events received over time
5. Below the graph, you will see a list of events (PageView, Purchase, etc.) with counts

---

## Step 7: Verify CAPI Is Working

If you set up the Conversions API, verify it is sending data correctly.

### How to Verify CAPI:

1. Go to **Events Manager**
2. Click on your Pixel
3. Click the **Overview** tab
4. Look at the events list — each event should show how it was received:
   - **Browser only** — Only received from Pixel
   - **Server only** — Only received from CAPI
   - **Browser & Server** — Received from both (this is what you want)
5. Click on the **Diagnostics** tab
6. Check for any warnings or errors related to CAPI

### Common CAPI Issues:

- **"Events not received"** — Check your server logs for errors in the API call
- **"Low match rate"** — You are not sending enough user data (email, phone, etc.) for Meta to match events to users. Send more user data parameters
- **"Duplicate events detected"** — Your deduplication is not working. Make sure you are using the same event ID in both Pixel and CAPI events
- **"Events delayed"** — CAPI events should be sent within minutes of the action occurring. If there is a long delay, Meta may not be able to attribute them correctly

<Tip>
Check the **Event Match Quality** score in Events Manager. This score (out of 10) tells you how well Meta can match your CAPI events to Facebook/Instagram users. A score of 6 or above is good. To improve it, send more user data parameters — hashed email, hashed phone number, IP address, user agent, fbc cookie, and fbp cookie.
</Tip>

---

## Step 8: Set Up Domain Verification

Domain verification proves to Meta that you own your website. This is important for proper Pixel functionality, especially after Apple's iOS 14.5 privacy changes.

### How to Verify Your Domain:

1. Go to **[business.facebook.com](https://business.facebook.com)**
2. Click the **Settings** gear icon
3. In the left sidebar, click **Brand Safety** → **Domains**
4. Click **Add** and enter your domain name (e.g., `yourwebsite.com`)
5. Meta will give you three verification options:
   - **DNS TXT record** — Add a text record to your domain's DNS settings
   - **HTML file upload** — Upload a verification file to your website's root folder
   - **Meta-tag verification** — Add a meta tag to your website's `<head>` section
6. Choose the method that is easiest for you (meta-tag is usually simplest)
7. Follow the instructions for your chosen method
8. Click **Verify**

### DNS TXT Record Method (Most Reliable):

1. Log into your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, etc.)
2. Find your domain's DNS settings
3. Add a new TXT record with the value Meta provides
4. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 72 hours, but usually much faster)
5. Go back to Meta and click **Verify**

### Meta-Tag Method (Quickest):

1. Copy the meta tag Meta provides (it looks like `<meta name="facebook-domain-verification" content="abcdefg123456" />`)
2. Paste it in your website's `<head>` section (same place you put the Pixel code)
3. Save and publish your website
4. Go back to Meta and click **Verify**

---

## Step 9: Configure Aggregated Event Measurement (AEM)

After Apple's iOS 14.5 update, Meta introduced Aggregated Event Measurement to comply with Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework. This limits you to **8 conversion events per domain** that can be used for optimization.

### How to Configure AEM:

1. Go to **Events Manager**
2. Click on your Pixel
3. Click the **Aggregated Event Measurement** tab
4. Click **Configure Web Events**
5. Select your **verified domain**
6. You will see 8 slots for events, ranked by priority
7. **Rank your events by importance** — the most important event goes at the top:
   - Priority 1 (highest): `Purchase` (or whatever your most valuable action is)
   - Priority 2: `Subscribe` or `CompleteRegistration`
   - Priority 3: `AddToCart` or `Lead`
   - Priority 4: `InitiateCheckout`
   - Priority 5-8: Other events you want to track
8. Click **Submit**

<Tip>
The ranking matters because when a user opts out of tracking on iOS, Meta can only report **one event** per user per conversion window — and it will report the highest-priority event. For example, if a user views a product, adds it to cart, and purchases, but they opted out of tracking, Meta will only report the Purchase (if it is your highest-priority event). So put your most valuable event at the top.
</Tip>

## Event Tracking Strategies for Different Business Types

### For E-Commerce Apps/Websites:

Recommended events to track (in priority order):
1. **Purchase** — The most important event
2. **AddToCart** — Shows buying intent
3. **InitiateCheckout** — Shows strong buying intent

## Troubleshooting Common Pixel Issues

### "Pixel is not firing"

**Possible causes:**
- The Pixel code is not on the page (check your source code)
- A JavaScript error is preventing the Pixel from loading
- An ad blocker is blocking the Pixel
- The Pixel ID is incorrect

**How to fix:**
1. View your page source (right-click → View Page Source)
2. Search for "fbq" or your Pixel ID
3. If found, check the browser console for JavaScript errors
4. If not found, re-install the Pixel code

### "Events are being received but not attributed to ads"

**Possible causes:**
- The attribution window has been exceeded
- The user is on iOS and opted out of tracking
- Domain verification is not set up
- Cookie restrictions are blocking attribution

**How to fix:**
1. Verify your domain is verified in Business Suite
2. Set up Conversions API for server-side attribution
3. Configure Aggregated Event Measurement

### "Duplicate events are being counted"

**Possible causes:**
- Event deduplication is not working between Pixel and CAPI
- The event code is firing multiple times on the same page
- The event is in both the base code and an additional code snippet

**How to fix:**
1. Check that you are using the same event ID in both Pixel and CAPI events
2. Check that event code only fires once per action (not on every page load)
3. Use the Meta Pixel Helper to see how many times each event fires

## What Comes Next

Your tracking foundation is now in place. Meta Pixel is tracking what happens in the browser, the Conversions API is tracking what happens on the server, and you have configured everything for optimal performance.

In the **First Campaign** guide, we will put this tracking to work by creating your first Meta ad campaign. The events you just set up will be available as optimization targets — so when you tell Meta "I want purchases," it will use all of this tracking data to find the people most likely to buy.

<Tip>
After your Pixel has been running for at least 24–48 hours, come back to Events Manager and check the data. You want to see consistent PageView events and any other events you configured. If you see a flat line with no data, something is wrong with your installation. Fix it before launching any campaigns — running ads without working tracking is like driving with your eyes closed.
