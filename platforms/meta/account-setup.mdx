## What You Will Set Up in This Guide

Before you can run any Meta ads, you need to create and configure a few accounts. Do not worry — this is a one-time setup that takes about 20–30 minutes. Once it is done, you never have to do it again.

Here is what we will set up together:

1. **A personal Facebook account** (if you do not already have one)
2. **A Facebook Page** for your business
3. **A Meta Business Suite account** (your business control panel)
4. **An Ad Account** inside Ads Manager
5. **A payment method** so Meta can charge you for your ads
6. **Two-factor authentication** to keep your account secure

Let us walk through each step together, one click at a time.

<Tip>
You need a personal Facebook account to manage business advertising, but your personal profile will NOT be visible in your ads. Your ads will appear under your Facebook Business Page's name, not your personal name. Your personal information stays completely private.
</Tip>

## Step 1: Make Sure You Have a Personal Facebook Account

Meta requires a personal Facebook account to access business tools. If you already have one, skip to Step 2.

### If You Need to Create a Facebook Account:

1. Open your web browser and go to **[facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com)**
2. You will see a sign-up form on the page
3. Enter your **first name** and **last name**
4. Enter your **email address** or **mobile phone number**
5. Create a **password** — make it strong (at least 12 characters, with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols)
6. Select your **birthday** from the dropdown menus
7. Select your **gender**
8. Click the **Sign Up** button
9. Facebook will send a verification code to your email or phone
10. Enter the **verification code** to confirm your account
11. You now have a personal Facebook account

<Tip>
Use your real name and a business email address when creating your Facebook account. Meta may ask you to verify your identity later, and having a real name makes this process much smoother. If they detect a fake name, they may disable your account — and your ad accounts along with it.
</Tip>

---

## Step 2: Create a Facebook Page for Your Business

A Facebook Page is the public face of your business on Meta. Your ads will run under this Page's name, and it is also where people can find your business, read reviews, and send you messages.

### How to Create Your Page:

1. Log into Facebook with your personal account
2. Click the **menu icon** (the nine dots, sometimes called the "waffle" icon) in the top-right corner of Facebook
3. Under the "Create" section, click **Page**
4. You will be taken to the Page creation flow
5. Enter your **Page name** — this should be your business name or app name
6. Choose a **category** — start typing what your business does (like "App" or "Software Company" or "Technology") and select the best match from the dropdown
7. Optionally, write a short **description** of what your business does (you can always change this later)
8. Click **Create Page**

### After Creating Your Page:

9. **Add a profile picture** — Click the camera icon on the profile picture area and upload your logo. Recommended size: 170 x 170 pixels
10. **Add a cover photo** — Click the camera icon on the large cover area and upload a banner image. Recommended size: 820 x 312 pixels
11. **Add your website URL** — Click "Edit Page Info" and add your website address
12. **Add your contact information** — Include an email address and phone number if applicable
13. Click **Save**

<Tip>
Your Facebook Page does not need to be perfect right now. You just need it to exist so you can run ads. You can always update the profile picture, cover photo, and description later. The most important thing is that the page name matches your business or app name so your ads look professional.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Set Up Meta Business Suite

Meta Business Suite is your central command center. It is where you manage your Facebook Page, Instagram account, ad accounts, pixels, and audiences — all in one place.

### How to Access Meta Business Suite:

1. Open your web browser and go to **[business.facebook.com](https://business.facebook.com)**
2. If you are already logged into Facebook, you will be taken directly to Business Suite
3. If you are not logged in, enter your Facebook email and password, then click **Log In**

### First Time Setup:

When you visit Business Suite for the first time, you may see a setup wizard. Here is what to do:

4. Meta may ask you to **select a business** or **create a new one**
5. If prompted to create a new business:
   - Enter your **business name** (your company or app name)
   - Enter your **name** (your personal name as the business admin)
   - Enter your **business email address**
   - Click **Submit**

6. Once you are inside Meta Business Suite, take a moment to look around. You will see a left sidebar with sections like:
   - **Home** — An overview dashboard
   - **Notifications** — Alerts and updates
   - **Planner** — Content scheduling
   - **Content** — Your posts and stories
   - **Ads** — Your advertising section
   - **Insights** — Performance analytics
   - **Audiences** — Your saved audiences

7. Click on the **Settings** gear icon (usually in the bottom-left corner)
8. Under "Business settings," make sure your business information is correct:
   - **Business name**
   - **Business address** (this may be required for ad account verification)
   - **Business phone number**
   - **Website URL**

<Tip>
Bookmark **business.facebook.com** right now. This is the URL you will use every time you want to manage your ads or check on your campaigns. It is your new best friend.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Set Up Your Ad Account

Your ad account is where your actual campaigns, budgets, and billing live. You may already have a default ad account created, but let us make sure it is configured correctly.

### Checking Your Existing Ad Account:

1. From Meta Business Suite, click the **Settings** gear icon
2. In the left sidebar, look for **Ad accounts** under the "Accounts" section
3. Click on **Ad accounts**
4. If you see an ad account listed, click on it to review the settings
5. If you do NOT see an ad account, you need to create one (see below)

### Creating a New Ad Account (If Needed):

1. From the Ad accounts section, click **Add** or **Create a new ad account**
2. Enter an **ad account name** — use something descriptive like "My App Name - Main Ad Account"
3. Select your **time zone** — this affects when your daily budget resets, so choose the time zone where most of your audience is located
4. Select your **currency** — this is the currency you will be billed in. **Important:** You cannot change the currency after the account is created, so choose carefully
5. Click **Create**

### Configuring Your Ad Account Settings:

6. Once your ad account is created, click on it to open its settings
7. Review the following:
   - **Ad account name:** Make sure it is descriptive
   - **Time zone:** Confirm it is correct
   - **Currency:** Confirm it is correct
   - **Business information:** Make sure your business name and address are filled in

<Tip>
The time zone you choose for your ad account determines when your daily budget resets. For example, if your audience is primarily in the United States (Eastern Time), choose US Eastern time. If you are running global campaigns, choose the time zone of your largest market. This cannot be changed after account creation, so think about it carefully.
</Tip>

## Step 5: Open Meta Ads Manager

Meta Ads Manager is the specific tool where you create and manage your ad campaigns. Let us make sure you can access it.

### How to Access Ads Manager:

1. Open your web browser and go to **[adsmanager.facebook.com](https://adsmanager.facebook.com)**
2. If you are logged into Facebook, Ads Manager will load directly
3. If you have multiple ad accounts, you may need to select the correct one from the dropdown at the top of the page

### Getting Familiar with Ads Manager:

Take a moment to explore the interface. Here is what you will see:

4. **The top navigation bar** — This shows your current ad account and has buttons for creating campaigns
5. **The Campaigns tab** — This shows all your campaigns (it will be empty right now)
6. **The Ad Sets tab** — This shows all your ad sets
7. **The Ads tab** — This shows all your individual ads
8. **The filter bar** — This lets you filter and search for specific campaigns
9. **The date range selector** — This lets you choose what time period to view data for

You do not need to create anything here yet — we just want to make sure you can access it. We will create your first campaign in a later guide.

<Tip>
You can switch between Meta Business Suite and Ads Manager at any time. Business Suite is great for a high-level overview, while Ads Manager gives you detailed control over your campaigns. Most experienced advertisers spend most of their time in Ads Manager because it offers more granular controls.
</Tip>

## Step 6: Add a Payment Method

Before you can run any ads, you need to tell Meta how to charge you. Meta supports several payment methods depending on your country.

### How to Add a Payment Method:

1. Go to **[adsmanager.facebook.com](https://adsmanager.facebook.com)**
2. Click the **gear icon** (Settings) or go to **Payment Settings** in the left sidebar
3. Alternatively, go to Business Suite → Settings → Payments
4. You will see the **Payment Methods** section
5. Click **Add Payment Method**
6. Choose your payment type:
   - **Credit or debit card** (Visa, Mastercard, American Express) — Most common and recommended
   - **PayPal** — Available in many countries
   - **Bank account (direct debit)** — Available in some countries
   - **Manual payment methods** — Available in certain regions (like boleto in Brazil)
7. Enter your payment information
8. Click **Save**

### After Adding Your Payment Method:

9. You will see your payment method listed under "Payment Methods"
10. If you added a credit card, Meta may place a small temporary hold (usually $1) to verify the card. This will be reversed
11. By default, Meta will charge you when your ad spend reaches your **billing threshold** or on your **monthly billing date**, whichever comes first

### Understanding Meta Billing:

- **Billing threshold:** The amount of ad spend that triggers a charge. This starts low (around $25) and increases as your account builds a good payment history
- **Monthly billing date:** If you do not reach your billing threshold during the month, Meta will charge you on this date for any remaining balance
- **You can see all charges** in the Billing section of your payment settings

<Tip>
We strongly recommend using a **credit card with no foreign transaction fees** for your Meta ad account. If your business is based outside the US, Meta may charge you in USD, and foreign transaction fees can add up. Check with your bank or credit card provider about their foreign transaction fee policy.
</Tip>

## Step 7: Enable Two-Factor Authentication

Your ad account has access to your payment method and can spend real money. Keeping it secure is critical. Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security.

### How to Enable 2FA:

1. Go to your personal Facebook account settings (click your profile picture → Settings & Privacy → Settings)
2. In the left sidebar, click **Security and Login** (or "Password and Security")
3. Find the **Two-Factor Authentication** section
4. Click **Edit** or **Get Started**
5. Choose your preferred method:
   - **Authentication app** (recommended) — Use apps like Google Authenticator, Authy, or 1Password
   - **Text message (SMS)** — Meta will send a code to your phone
   - **Security key** — A physical USB key (most secure but requires hardware)
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete setup
7. **Save your backup codes** — Meta will give you a set of backup codes. Store these somewhere safe (like a password manager). If you lose access to your 2FA method, these codes are your only way back in

### How 2FA Works After Setup:

- When you log in from a new device or browser, Facebook will ask for your password PLUS a code from your authentication app or a text message
- This means even if someone steals your password, they cannot access your account without also having your phone

<Tip>
If you are managing your business's ad account, **require 2FA for everyone** who has access to your Business Suite. You can do this in Business Suite → Settings → Security Center. One compromised team member's account can give hackers access to your entire ad account and budget.
</Tip>

## Step 8: Connect Your Instagram Account (Optional but Recommended)

If you want your ads to appear on Instagram (and you should — Instagram is one of Meta's best-performing placements), you should connect your Instagram account to your Business Suite.

### How to Connect Instagram:

1. Go to **[business.facebook.com](https://business.facebook.com)**
2. Click the **Settings** gear icon
3. In the left sidebar, look for **Accounts** and click **Instagram accounts**
4. Click **Add Instagram Account** or **Connect Account**
5. Enter your **Instagram username** and **password**
6. Click **Log In**
7. Follow any additional verification steps Instagram requires
8. Your Instagram account is now connected to your Business Suite

### What If You Do Not Have an Instagram Account?

That is fine. You can still run ads on Instagram — they will appear under your Facebook Page's name instead. However, having a dedicated Instagram account for your business is recommended because:

- It looks more professional
- People who see your Instagram ads can visit your Instagram profile
- You can build an organic Instagram following alongside your ads

### Creating an Instagram Business Account:

1. Download the **Instagram app** on your phone
2. Open the app and tap **Sign Up**
3. Create an account using your business email
4. Once your personal Instagram account is created, go to **Settings → Account → Switch to Professional Account**
5. Choose **Business** (not Creator)
6. Select a **category** for your business
7. Connect it to your Facebook Page when prompted
8. Your Instagram Business account is now ready

<Tip>
An Instagram Business account gives you access to Instagram Insights (analytics), the ability to add links to Stories, and the ability to run ads directly from the Instagram app. Always use a Business account for your brand — not a personal account.
</Tip>

## Step 9: Verify Your Business (Recommended)

Meta offers business verification, which proves to Meta that your business is legitimate. While not always required, verification gives you access to additional features and higher ad account limits.

### Why Verify?

- **Higher ad spending limits** — Unverified accounts may have lower daily spending caps
- **Access to more features** — Some advanced features (like certain Custom Audience types) require verification
- **More trust from Meta** — Verified businesses are less likely to have their accounts flagged or restricted
- **Required for some industries** — If you are advertising in sensitive categories (health, finance, social issues), verification may be required

### How to Start Verification:

1. Go to **[business.facebook.com](https://business.facebook.com)**
2. Click the **Settings** gear icon
3. Look for **Security Center** or **Business Verification** in the left sidebar
4. Click **Start Verification**
5. Meta will ask you to:
   - Confirm your business details (name, address, phone number, website)
   - Upload official business documents (like a business license, utility bill, or bank statement)
   - Verify your domain (proving you own your website)
6. Meta will review your submission, which can take a few days to a few weeks

<Tip>
You do not need to be verified to start running ads. But we recommend starting the verification process early because it can take time. You can run ads while your verification is pending. Think of it as background paperwork — start it now and forget about it until it is approved.
</Tip>

## Step 10: Set Up Your Notifications

Staying on top of your ad performance requires knowing what is happening with your campaigns. Let us configure your notification settings so you are informed without being overwhelmed.

### How to Configure Notifications:

1. In Ads Manager, click the **gear icon** (Settings)
2. Look for **Notification Settings**
3. We recommend enabling notifications for:
   - **Ad approvals and rejections** — So you know immediately if an ad was rejected
   - **Campaign performance alerts** — So you know if something is performing unusually well or poorly
   - **Billing notifications** — So you know when you are charged
   - **Account security alerts** — So you know if someone tries to access your account
4. We recommend disabling notifications for:
   - Marketing tips from Meta (these are ads from Meta trying to get you to spend more)
   - Feature announcements (unless you want to stay updated on new ad features)

### Setting Up Email Notifications:

5. In your notification settings, choose which alerts should be sent to your **email**
6. We recommend getting email alerts for ad rejections and billing issues
7. For everything else, checking Ads Manager once or twice a day is sufficient

<Tip>
Do not check your ads every hour. Seriously. The data needs time to accumulate before it is meaningful. When you are starting out, check your campaigns **once in the morning** and **once in the evening**. That is enough. Obsessively checking every hour leads to panic-driven decisions based on incomplete data.
</Tip>

## Step 11: Assign Roles (For Teams)

If you are working with a team, you will want to give other people access to your Business Suite and ad accounts. Meta lets you assign different levels of access to different people.

### Available Roles:

- **Admin:** Full access to everything — can manage settings, ad accounts, people, and pages
- **Employee:** Can see and use assigned assets (like ad accounts) but cannot change business settings
- **Finance Analyst:** Can see financial information like billing and transactions
- **Finance Editor:** Can manage financial settings

### How to Add Team Members:

1. Go to **[business.facebook.com](https://business.facebook.com)**
2. Click the **Settings** gear icon
3. In the left sidebar, click **People**
4. Click **Add People**
5. Enter the person's **email address** (it must be connected to a Facebook account)
6. Choose their **role** (Admin or Employee)
7. Select which **assets** they should have access to (ad accounts, pages, pixels, etc.)
8. Click **Send Invitation**
9. The person will receive an email with an invitation to join your Business Suite

<Tip>
Follow the principle of least privilege — give people only the access they need. If someone only needs to create and manage ads, make them an Employee with access to the ad account. Only make someone an Admin if they need full control over business settings and billing.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

### "My ad account is disabled"

This sometimes happens with new accounts. Meta may disable accounts they suspect are fraudulent.

**What to do:**
1. Go to [facebook.com/accountquality](https://www.facebook.com/accountquality)
2. Check if there is a message about your account
3. If you can request a review, do so immediately
4. Make sure your business information is complete and accurate
5. If asked for verification documents, provide them promptly

### "I cannot find Ads Manager"

**What to do:**
1. Make sure you are going to [adsmanager.facebook.com](https://adsmanager.facebook.com) (not regular facebook.com)
2. Make sure you are logged into the correct Facebook account
3. If you have multiple Business Suite accounts, make sure you are in the right one
4. Try clearing your browser cache and cookies, then logging in again

### "My payment method was rejected"

**What to do:**
1. Double-check that your card number, expiration date, and CVV are correct
2. Make sure the billing address matches what your bank has on file
3. Check with your bank — they may be blocking the transaction as suspicious
4. Try a different payment method
5. If using a debit card, make sure there are sufficient funds

### "I was asked to verify my identity"

**What to do:**
1. This is normal, especially for new accounts or accounts running ads for the first time
2. Follow the instructions Meta provides — they may ask for a photo ID
3. Upload a clear photo of your ID (passport, driver's license, or national ID card)
4. Wait for review (usually 1–5 business days)
5. Do not create a new account — this will make things worse

## What Comes Next

Congratulations — your Meta advertising foundation is now in place. You have a Business Suite account, an ad account, a payment method, and proper security settings. You are ready to move on to the next step.

In the **Pixel Setup** guide, we will install Meta Pixel on your website and configure the Conversions API. This is essential for tracking what happens after people click your ads, which is how you will measure success and optimize your campaigns.

<Tip>
Take a screenshot of your Business Suite dashboard right now and save it somewhere safe. If you ever need to contact Meta support, having your Business Suite ID and Ad Account ID readily available will save you a lot of time. You can find your Business ID in Settings → Business Info.
