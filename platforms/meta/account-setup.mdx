## Before you touch a single ad

You need two things set up before you can run Meta ads:

1. **Meta Business Manager** — the control center for everything
2. **Ad Account** — where you actually create and manage campaigns

Skipping this setup (or doing it wrong) causes headaches later. Let's do it right the first time.

## What you'll learn

- How to create a Meta Business Manager
- How to set up your ad account with the right settings
- How to add your app and configure it properly
- How to set up payment and spending limits
- How to add team members with the right permissions

## Step 1: Create your Business Manager

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to business.facebook.com">
    Navigate to [business.facebook.com](https://business.facebook.com) and click **Create Account**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your business details">
    Use your real business name (not your personal name). This shows up in some ad contexts, so keep it professional.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your business email">
    Use a team email if possible (like ads@yourcompany.com). Avoid using a personal Gmail — if that person leaves, you lose access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete verification">
    Confirm your email and fill out any additional business info Meta requests.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Use your real business information.** Meta regularly bans accounts that look fake or suspicious. Fake names, mismatched addresses, and brand-new Facebook profiles are red flags that can get you permanently banned.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Create your ad account

Once inside Business Manager:

1. Go to **Business Settings** > **Accounts** > **Ad Accounts**
2. Click **Add** > **Create a New Ad Account**
3. Set these critical details:
   - **Account name:** Something descriptive (e.g., "MyApp - US Growth")
   - **Time zone:** Set to your primary market's timezone
   - **Currency:** Set to the currency you want to pay in

<Note>
  **You can't change the timezone or currency after creation.** Double-check before you confirm. If you mess up, you'll need to create a new ad account.
</Note>

## Step 3: Add your app

To run app install campaigns, Meta needs to know about your app:

1. Go to **Business Settings** > **Accounts** > **Apps**
2. Click **Add** and enter your **App Store ID** or **Google Play package name**
3. Meta will automatically pull in your app details

If your app isn't live in the stores yet, you can still create the connection — just know you can't run app install ads until the app is publicly available.

## Step 4: Set up payment

Go to **Payment Settings** in your ad account and add a payment method:

- **Credit/debit card** — simplest option
- **PayPal** — works in most countries
- **Bank account** — available for larger advertisers

<Tip>
  **Set a spending limit** on your ad account when you're starting out. Go to **Payment Settings** > **Account Spending Limit** and set a cap (like $500). This is your safety net — Meta can't charge you more than this amount total. You can always raise it later.
</Tip>

## Step 5: Add team members (optional)

If other people need access:

1. Go to **Business Settings** > **People**
2. Click **Add People** and enter their email
3. Assign the right role:

| Role | What they can do | Best for |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| **Admin** | Everything, including adding/removing people | Founders, lead marketers |
| **Advertiser** | Create and edit campaigns, view reports | Marketing team members |
| **Analyst** | View reports only | Stakeholders who need data |

## Your account setup checklist

Before moving on, confirm you have:

- [ ] Business Manager created with real business info
- [ ] Ad account created with correct timezone and currency
- [ ] App registered in Business Manager
- [ ] Payment method added
- [ ] Spending limit set (recommended for beginners)
- [ ] Two-factor authentication enabled (seriously, do this)
