## Good campaigns aren't born — they're optimized

Your first campaign won't be your best. That's expected. The difference between advertisers who succeed and those who waste money is **systematic optimization.** Read the data, make smart changes, repeat.

## What you'll learn

- Which metrics actually matter (and which to ignore)
- How to diagnose underperforming campaigns
- When and how to make changes without resetting the algorithm
- Creative optimization strategies
- Budget scaling techniques

## The metrics that matter

There are dozens of metrics in Ads Manager. Focus on these:

| Metric | What it means | Good range (app installs) |
|--------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **CPI (Cost Per Install)** | How much you pay per app install | $1-5 (varies by category) |
| **CTR (Click-Through Rate)** | % of people who click your ad | 1-3% |
| **CVR (Conversion Rate)** | % of clicks that become installs | 20-40% |
| **CPM (Cost Per 1,000 Impressions)** | How much it costs to reach 1,000 people | $5-15 |
| **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)** | Revenue generated per dollar spent | > 1.0 to be profitable |
| **Frequency** | Average times each person sees your ad | Keep below 3-4 |

<Note>
  **CPI alone doesn't tell the full story.** Track downstream metrics too — what do users do after they install? A high CPI with great retention might be better than a low CPI with massive churn.
</Note>

## The optimization decision tree

When performance dips, diagnose the problem systematically:

```
Low results?
├── Low impressions?
│   → Budget too low or audience too small
├── Low CTR?
│   → Creative or targeting problem — people see your ad but don't care
├── High CTR but low CVR?
│   → App store page problem — people click but don't install
└── Good installs but bad ROAS?
    → Targeting quality problem — wrong users are installing
```

## Creative optimization

Creative is the #1 lever for improving Meta ad performance. The algorithm can only work with what you give it.

### The testing framework

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with 3-5 ad variations">
    Same audience, different creatives. Test different images, videos, headlines, or copy angles.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run for 5-7 days">
    Give each variation enough time and budget to get statistically meaningful results (aim for 1,000+ impressions per ad).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Identify the winner">
    Look at CPI and CTR. The ad with the lowest CPI and decent volume is your winner.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Iterate on the winner">
    Take what worked and create new variations. If a video of your app in action won, make 3 more videos with different hooks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Repeat weekly">
    Creative fatigue is real. Even great ads decline after 2-4 weeks. Always have fresh creative in the pipeline.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What to test (in priority order)

1. **Visual format** — Image vs. video vs. carousel
2. **Hook** — The first 3 seconds of a video or the main image concept
3. **Copy angle** — Problem-focused vs. benefit-focused vs. social proof
4. **Call to action** — "Install Now" vs. "Learn More" vs. "Try Free"
5. **Headline** — Different value propositions

<Tip>
  **Test one variable at a time.** If you change the image AND the copy AND the audience all at once, you won't know what caused the improvement (or decline).
</Tip>

## Budget optimization

### When to increase budget

Increase budget when a campaign has:
- Been out of learning phase for 3+ days
- Consistent CPI within your target range
- Positive ROAS (if you're tracking revenue)

### How to increase budget safely

The golden rule: **increase by no more than 20% every 3-4 days.** Larger jumps can reset the learning phase and destabilize performance.

```
Week 1: $15/day (testing)
Week 2: $18/day (+20%)
Week 3: $22/day (+20%)
Week 4: $26/day (+20%)
```

### When to pause or kill a campaign

Pause a campaign if:
- CPI is 2x+ your target after 7 days
- Zero installs after 3 days with sufficient budget
- Frequency is above 4 (audience saturation)
- ROAS is consistently below 0.5

## Common mistakes to avoid

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Editing during learning" icon="rotate">
    Making significant changes during the learning phase (first 50 conversions) resets the algorithm. Be patient.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Too many ad sets" icon="layer-group">
    Running 10 ad sets with $5 each gives worse results than 2 ad sets with $25 each. Consolidate for better optimization.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ignoring creative fatigue" icon="battery-quarter">
    Every ad has a shelf life. When CTR drops and frequency rises, it's time for fresh creative — not more budget.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Optimizing too early" icon="clock">
    Making decisions based on 2 days of data is like judging a book by its cover. Wait for statistical significance.

## Weekly optimization routine

Here's a simple weekly checklist:

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Monday** | Review last week's performance. Pause underperformers. |
| **Wednesday** | Launch new creative tests. Adjust budgets on winners. |
| **Friday** | Check frequency and audience overlap. Plan next week's creative. |

<Warning>
  **Don't check your ads every hour.** It's tempting, but it leads to anxiety and premature changes. Check once or twice a day, optimize weekly.
</Warning>
