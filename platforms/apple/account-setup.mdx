## The simplest ad account you'll ever set up

Apple keeps things refreshingly simple. No Business Manager, no linked accounts maze, no pixel installation. If you have an Apple ID and a live app, you're 10 minutes from being ready.

## What you'll learn

- How to create your Apple Search Ads account
- How to configure billing and budget limits
- How to invite team members
- How to optimize your App Store listing (your ad creative)

## Account creation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to searchads.apple.com">
    Visit [searchads.apple.com](https://searchads.apple.com) and click **Start**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign in with your Apple ID">
    Use the Apple ID associated with your App Store Connect account. This automatically gives you access to your apps.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Basic or Advanced">
    Pick **Search Ads Basic** if you're new (you can upgrade anytime). Pick **Advanced** if you want keyword-level control from the start.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add payment information">
    Add a credit or debit card. Apple charges you based on actual spend (no prepayment required).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accept the terms">
    Review and accept Apple's advertising terms. Done — you have an account.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Use the same Apple ID that owns your app** in App Store Connect. This gives you automatic access to your app for advertising. If you use a different Apple ID, you'll need to request access through your app's admin.
</Tip>

## Configure your settings

### Budget controls

Set account-level budget limits to protect yourself:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Budget Orders**
2. Create a budget order with a maximum spend amount
3. Set a start and end date

This ensures you never accidentally overspend, even if individual campaign budgets are set higher.

### Invite team members

1. Go to **Settings** > **User Management**
2. Click **Invite User**
3. Enter their Apple ID email and assign a role:

| Role | Permissions | Best for |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Account Admin** | Full access, manage users | Founders |
| **Campaign Manager** | Create/edit campaigns | Marketing team |
| **Read Only** | View reports | Stakeholders |

## Optimize your App Store listing first

Here's what makes Apple Search Ads unique: **your App Store page IS your ad.** Apple uses your existing app listing — icon, name, subtitle, screenshots — as the ad creative. You can't upload custom images.

This means your App Store Optimization (ASO) directly impacts your ad performance:

  <Card title="App Icon" icon="image">
    This is the first thing users see. Make it clean, recognizable, and stand out from competitors.
  </Card>
  <Card title="App Name & Subtitle" icon="text">
    Include your most important keyword in the name or subtitle. Keep it clear and descriptive.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Screenshots" icon="images">
    Your first 2-3 screenshots appear in the ad. Make them show your app's best features with clear, readable text overlays.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ratings & Reviews" icon="star">
    Apps with 4.0+ stars and solid review counts convert significantly better. Focus on your in-app rating prompt.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  **Don't launch Apple Search Ads with a weak App Store page.** Since you can't customize the ad creative, your listing needs to sell the app on its own. Spend time on your screenshots and description before spending money on ads.
</Warning>
