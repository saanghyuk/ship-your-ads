## Everything you need before your first ad dollar is spent

Apple Search Ads has the simplest account setup of any major ad platform. No Business Manager. No pixel installation. No domain verification. If you have an Apple ID and a live app, you can be ready in 15 minutes.

But there are important details that trip people up — payment configuration, team permissions, budget controls, and (if you want attribution data in your app) the Search Ads Attribution API. This guide covers all of it.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

| Requirement | Details | How to get it |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| **Apple Developer account** | The $99/year program that lets you publish apps | [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com) |
| **A live app in the App Store** | Your app must be published and available for download | Submit through App Store Connect |
| **An Apple ID** | Preferably the one that owns the app in App Store Connect | You already have one if you have a Developer account |
| **A credit or debit card** | Visa, Mastercard, or AMEX | Personal or business card |

<Note>
  **You do NOT need a separate business entity or business verification.** Unlike Meta or TikTok, Apple does not require business documents. Any individual with an Apple Developer account can run Search Ads.
</Note>

## Step 1: Create your Apple Search Ads account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to searchads.apple.com">
    Open your browser and visit [searchads.apple.com](https://searchads.apple.com). Click the **Start** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign in with your Apple ID">
    Use the Apple ID that is associated with your App Store Connect account. This is critical — it automatically links your apps.

    **If you use a different Apple ID:** You will not see your apps. You will need to be invited by the account admin in App Store Connect, which adds unnecessary complexity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your account type">
    Apple will ask if you want **Search Ads Basic** or **Search Ads Advanced**.

    - Choose **Basic** if you want to start simple (you can add Advanced later)
    - Choose **Advanced** if you want full keyword control from day one
    - You can run BOTH simultaneously — they are separate dashboards

    <Tip>
      You can create both a Basic and Advanced account with the same Apple ID. Many developers run Basic for one campaign and Advanced for another.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accept the Apple Advertising Terms">
    Read and accept the terms of service. This is a standard agreement covering Apple's advertising policies, payment terms, and content guidelines.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Your account is created">
    That is it for account creation. You now have access to the Apple Search Ads dashboard. The next steps are configuring payment and settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Set up payment

Apple charges you based on actual spend — there is no prepayment required. You provide a credit card, and Apple charges it as you spend.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to payment settings">
    **For Basic:** Go to **Settings** (gear icon) > **Payment**

    **For Advanced:** Go to **Account Settings** > **Billing** > **Payment Methods**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your credit or debit card">
    Enter your card details:
    - Card number
    - Expiration date
    - CVV
    - Billing address (must match your card's billing address)

    Apple accepts Visa, Mastercard, and American Express.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set your billing threshold (Advanced only)">
    Apple charges your card when your spending reaches a billing threshold OR at the end of the month, whichever comes first. The initial threshold is typically $500 and increases as you build payment history.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Make sure your card has sufficient funds and no spending limits that would block charges.** If a charge fails, Apple will pause all your campaigns until payment is resolved. This can cost you days of lost traffic.
</Warning>

### Understanding billing

| Billing aspect | How it works |
|---------------|-------------|
| **When you are charged** | When you hit your billing threshold OR at month end |
| **Initial threshold** | Typically $500 (increases over time) |
| **Currency** | Billed in your local currency based on your billing address |
| **Tax** | Varies by country. In the US, no sales tax on ad spend |
| **Refunds** | Apple does not refund ad spend. Be careful with budget settings |
| **Payment failure** | All campaigns pause immediately until resolved |

## Step 3: Set up budget controls (Advanced)

Budget controls are your safety net. They prevent accidental overspending, which is especially important when you are learning.

### Budget orders

A budget order is an account-level spending cap that overrides everything else.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to budget orders">
    In Search Ads Advanced, navigate to **Account Settings** > **Budget Orders**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new budget order">
    Click **Create Budget Order** and fill in:
    - **Order name:** Something descriptive like "Q1 2026 Budget"
    - **Budget amount:** The maximum total spend (e.g., $1,000)
    - **Start date:** When spending can begin
    - **End date:** When to stop spending
    - **PO number** (optional): For your own accounting reference
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign campaigns to the budget order">
    When you create campaigns, you will assign them to this budget order. Total campaign spending cannot exceed the budget order amount.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Always create a budget order before your first campaign.** Set it to an amount you are comfortable losing entirely while learning. A good starting budget order is $500-1,000 for your first month.
</Tip>

### Campaign-level budget controls

In addition to budget orders, each campaign has its own controls:

| Control | What it does | Recommendation |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Campaign budget** | Total lifetime spend for the campaign | Set to match your budget order |
| **Daily cap** | Maximum spend per day | Start with $15-25/day |

<Note>
  **How daily caps work:** If you set a $20 daily cap, Apple will try to spend up to $20 per day. On some days, Apple may spend slightly more or less, but the average will be near your cap. Apple may overspend by up to 2x on a single day but will balance it over the month.
</Note>

## Step 4: Configure campaign groups (Advanced)

Campaign groups are an optional organizational layer that helps you manage multiple campaigns.

Think of them like folders:

```
Account
├── Campaign Group: US Market
│   ├── Campaign: US - Brand Keywords
│   ├── Campaign: US - Category Keywords
│   └── Campaign: US - Discovery
├── Campaign Group: UK Market
│   ├── Campaign: UK - Brand Keywords
│   └── Campaign: UK - Category Keywords
└── Campaign Group: Test Campaigns
    └── Campaign: New Keywords Test
```

To create a campaign group:

1. In Search Ads Advanced, go to the **Campaigns** dashboard
2. Click **Create Campaign Group**
3. Name it something descriptive
4. Assign campaigns to it during campaign creation

<Tip>
  **You do not need campaign groups when starting out.** They become useful when you have 5+ campaigns and need to organize by country, strategy, or app.
</Tip>

## Step 5: Set up team roles and permissions

If you work with a team or agency, you can invite others to your Apple Search Ads account with specific permissions.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to user management">
    Go to **Account Settings** > **User Management**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Invite User">
    Enter the Apple ID email of the person you want to invite.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign a role">
    Choose the appropriate role for each team member.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Available roles

| Role | What they can do | Best for |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| **Account Admin** | Full access: create/edit/delete campaigns, manage billing, invite users, access API | Founders, lead marketers |
| **Campaign Manager** | Create and edit campaigns, view reports, manage keywords. Cannot manage billing or users | Marketing team members |
| **Read Only** | View campaigns and reports. Cannot make changes | Stakeholders, investors, clients |

<Note>
  **Each person needs their own Apple ID.** You cannot share login credentials. Apple IDs are free to create — the person does not need an Apple Developer account to be invited to your Search Ads account.
</Note>

### Managing agency access

If you hire an agency or freelancer:

1. Invite them with **Campaign Manager** role (not Admin)
2. Create a separate budget order for their campaigns
3. Set daily caps to limit spending
4. Review their activity weekly in the change history log
5. Remove access immediately when the engagement ends

## Step 6: Set up the Apple Search Ads Attribution API (in your app)

The Attribution API lets your app know when a user installed because of an Apple Search Ads ad. This is optional but very valuable — it lets you track which keywords and campaigns drive not just installs, but in-app actions like signups and purchases.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Swift (iOS Native)">
    ### Step 1: Import the framework

    The `AdServices` framework is available in iOS 14.3+ and replaces the older `iAd` framework.

    ```swift
    import AdServices
    ```

    ### Step 2: Request the attribution token

    Call this as early as possible after app launch, typically in your `AppDelegate` or initial view controller:

    ```swift
    import AdServices
    import UIKit

    class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

        func application(
            _ application: UIApplication,
            didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
        ) -> Bool {

            // Request Apple Search Ads attribution
            requestSearchAdsAttribution()
            return true
        }

        func requestSearchAdsAttribution() {
            // AdServices framework (iOS 14.3+)
            if #available(iOS 14.3, *) {
                do {
                    let token = try AAAttribution.attributionToken()
                    // Send this token to your server for attribution lookup
                    sendTokenToServer(token: token)
                } catch {
                    print("Failed to get attribution token: \(error)")
                }
            }
        }

        func sendTokenToServer(token: String) {
            // Send the token to Apple's Attribution API endpoint
            // via your backend server
            guard let url = URL(string: "https://yourserver.com/api/attribution") else { return }

            var request = URLRequest(url: url)
            request.httpMethod = "POST"
            request.setValue("application/json", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")

            let body: [String: String] = ["attributionToken": token]
            request.httpBody = try? JSONSerialization.data(withJSONObject: body)

            URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request) { data, response, error in
                if let error = error {
                    print("Attribution upload failed: \(error)")
                    return
                }
                print("Attribution token sent successfully")
            }.resume()
        }
    }
    ```

    ### Step 3: Server-side token resolution

    Your server sends the token to Apple's API to get attribution data:

    ```swift
    // Server-side code (can be in any language)
    // POST https://api-adservices.apple.com/api/v1/

    // Request:
    // Header: Content-Type: text/plain
    // Body: the attribution token string

    // Response (JSON):
    // {
    //   "attribution": true,
    //   "orgId": 1234567890,
    //   "campaignId": 1234567890,
    //   "conversionType": "Download",
    //   "adGroupId": 1234567890,
    //   "keywordId": 1234567890,
    //   "creativeSetId": 1234567890,
    //   "region": "US",
    //   "clickDate": "2026-02-19T12:00:00Z"
    // }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="React Native">
    ### Option A: Using react-native-apple-ads-attribution

    Install the community library:

    ```bash
    npm install react-native-apple-ads-attribution
    cd ios && pod install
    ```

    Use it in your app:

    ```typescript
    import { getAttributionToken } from 'react-native-apple-ads-attribution';

    // Call this on app startup
    async function checkSearchAdsAttribution(): Promise<void> {
      try {
        // Get the attribution token (iOS 14.3+)
        const token: string = await getAttributionToken();

        // Send token to your backend for resolution
        await fetch('https://yourserver.com/api/attribution', {
          method: 'POST',
          headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
          body: JSON.stringify({ attributionToken: token }),
        });

        console.log('Attribution token sent successfully');
      } catch (error) {
        // This will fail on Android or iOS < 14.3
        console.log('Attribution not available:', error);
      }
    }

    // Call on app launch
    checkSearchAdsAttribution();
    ```

    ### Option B: Using a native module (if the library doesn't meet your needs)

    Create a native module bridge:

    ```swift
    // ios/SearchAdsAttribution.swift
    import Foundation
    import AdServices

    @objc(SearchAdsAttribution)
    class SearchAdsAttribution: NSObject {

      @objc
      func getAttributionToken(
        _ resolve: @escaping RCTPromiseResolveBlock,
        rejecter reject: @escaping RCTPromiseRejectBlock
      ) {
        if #available(iOS 14.3, *) {
          do {
            let token = try AAAttribution.attributionToken()
            resolve(token)
          } catch {
            reject("ATTRIBUTION_ERROR", "Failed to get token", error)
          }
        } else {
          reject("UNSUPPORTED", "Requires iOS 14.3+", nil)
        }
      }

      @objc
      static func requiresMainQueueSetup() -> Bool {
        return false
      }
    }
    ```

    ```objc
    // ios/SearchAdsAttribution.m
    #import <React/RCTBridgeModule.h>

    @interface RCT_EXTERN_MODULE(SearchAdsAttribution, NSObject)

    RCT_EXTERN_METHOD(getAttributionToken:
                      (RCTPromiseResolveBlock)resolve
                      rejecter:(RCTPromiseRejectBlock)reject)

    @end
    ```

    Then use it in TypeScript:

    ```typescript
    import { NativeModules, Platform } from 'react-native';

    const { SearchAdsAttribution } = NativeModules;

    async function getAppleSearchAdsAttribution(): Promise<string | null> {
      if (Platform.OS !== 'ios') return null;

      try {
        const token: string = await SearchAdsAttribution.getAttributionToken();
        return token;
      } catch (error) {
        console.log('Search Ads attribution not available:', error);
        return null;
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Flutter">
    ### Using the ad_services plugin

    ```bash
    flutter pub add ad_services
    ```

    ```dart
    import 'package:ad_services/ad_services.dart';
    import 'dart:io';

    Future<void> checkSearchAdsAttribution() async {
      if (!Platform.isIOS) return;

      try {
        // Get attribution token (iOS 14.3+)
        final String? token = await AdServices.getAttributionToken();

        if (token != null) {
          // Send token to your backend
          // Your backend calls Apple's API to resolve the token
          print('Attribution token: $token');
        }
      } catch (e) {
        print('Attribution not available: $e');
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
  **The attribution token must be resolved server-side.** Your app gets a token, but you must send it to Apple's API (`https://api-adservices.apple.com/api/v1/`) from your server to get the actual attribution data (campaign ID, keyword, etc.). Do NOT call Apple's API directly from the app.
</Warning>

### What you get from the Attribution API

When you resolve a token, Apple returns data that tells you:

| Field | What it tells you |
|-------|------------------|
| `attribution` | `true` if the install came from an Apple Search Ads ad |
| `campaignId` | Which campaign drove the install |
| `adGroupId` | Which ad group within the campaign |
| `keywordId` | Which keyword triggered the ad |
| `creativeSetId` | Which creative set was shown |
| `region` | Which country the user was in |
| `conversionType` | "Download" (new) or "Redownload" |

<Tip>
  **If you use a third-party MMP** (AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, Singular, etc.), they handle all of this automatically. You do not need to implement the Attribution API manually — your MMP's SDK does it for you and provides unified attribution across all your ad channels.
</Tip>

## Step 7: Set up the Apple Search Ads API (for automation)

If you want to programmatically manage campaigns, pull reports, or build dashboards, Apple provides a full REST API.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate API credentials">
    In Search Ads Advanced, go to **Account Settings** > **API**.

    Click **Create API Certificate**. Download the certificate files:
    - Private key file (`.key`)
    - Public certificate file (`.pem`)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Note your credentials">
    You will need:
    - **Client ID**
    - **Team ID**
    - **Key ID**
    - Your private key file
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate via OAuth 2.0">
    Apple Search Ads API uses OAuth 2.0 with JSON Web Tokens (JWT):

    ```python
    # Python example for generating a JWT token
    import jwt
    import datetime

    # Your credentials from Apple Search Ads
    CLIENT_ID = "SEARCHADS.your-client-id"
    TEAM_ID = "your-team-id"
    KEY_ID = "your-key-id"

    # Read your private key
    with open("private-key.pem", "r") as f:
        private_key = f.read()

    # Generate the JWT
    now = datetime.datetime.utcnow()
    payload = {
        "sub": CLIENT_ID,
        "aud": "https://appleid.apple.com",
        "iat": now,
        "exp": now + datetime.timedelta(hours=1),
        "iss": TEAM_ID,
    }
    headers = {
        "kid": KEY_ID,
        "alg": "ES256",
    }

    token = jwt.encode(payload, private_key, algorithm="ES256", headers=headers)
    print(f"Bearer token: {token}")
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make API calls">
    Use the token to call the Search Ads API:

    ```bash
    # Example: Get all campaigns
    curl -X GET "https://api.searchads.apple.com/api/v5/campaigns" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
      -H "X-AP-Context: orgId=YOUR_ORG_ID"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **You do not need the API to get started.** The API is for advanced automation — building custom dashboards, automatically adjusting bids, or syncing data with your analytics tools. You can manage everything through the web interface when starting out.
</Note>

## Step 8: Optimize your App Store listing (your ad creative)

This step is so important it deserves its own section. On Apple Search Ads, **your App Store page IS your ad.** You cannot upload custom ad images or videos. Apple generates your ad from your existing listing.

This means your App Store Optimization (ASO) directly determines your ad's performance.

### What Apple uses to build your ad

| Element | Where it appears in the ad | Optimization tips |
|---------|--------------------------|------------------|
| **App icon** | Thumbnail on the left | Make it clean, recognizable, and distinct from competitors. Avoid text in the icon. |
| **App name** | Main headline | Include your primary keyword (e.g., "Clarity - Meditation & Sleep"). 30 character limit. |
| **Subtitle** | Below the name | Include a secondary keyword or value proposition. 30 character limit. |
| **Screenshots (first 3)** | Displayed when ad is expanded | Make the first 3 screenshots your strongest — they are what users see in the ad. Use clear text overlays. |
| **Star rating** | Next to the name | Apps with 4.5+ stars convert significantly better. Focus on your in-app rating prompt. |
| **Price/Free label** | Next to the name | Free apps get more taps. If your app is paid, ensure the value is clear. |

### Screenshot optimization for Search Ads

Your screenshots are the single biggest factor in conversion rate. Here is what to do:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Screenshot 1: Lead with your strongest feature">
    The first screenshot is the most important — it is always visible in the ad. Show your app's primary value proposition. Use a clear text overlay that says what the app does in 5 words or less.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Screenshot 2: Show social proof or a key benefit">
    Show something compelling: user count, a unique feature, or a before/after. This screenshot appears in the expanded ad view.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Screenshot 3: Demonstrate the experience">
    Show the actual app interface doing something useful. Users want to see what they will get after installing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Screenshots 4-10: Complete the story">
    These do not appear in Search Ads but matter for your App Store page (where users land after tapping the ad). Cover all major features, settings, and use cases.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Custom product pages (Advanced only)

With Search Ads Advanced, you can create **Custom Product Pages** in App Store Connect. These are alternate versions of your app listing with different screenshots and promotional text.

Why this matters: You can show different screenshots to different audiences. For example:
- Users searching "workout app" see fitness-focused screenshots
- Users searching "nutrition tracker" see food-tracking screenshots
- Both search queries lead to the same app, but with tailored messaging

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create custom product pages in App Store Connect">
    Go to App Store Connect > Your App > **Custom Product Pages**. Create up to 35 different page variations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link them to ad groups in Search Ads Advanced">
    In your campaign, you can assign a custom product page to a specific ad group. When users in that ad group tap your ad, they see your custom page instead of the default listing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Pre-launch checklist

Before you create your first campaign, verify everything is in place:

- [ ] Apple Search Ads account created at [searchads.apple.com](https://searchads.apple.com)
