## Let's get you some installs

Apple Search Ads campaigns are the fastest to set up of any ad platform. If you're using Basic, you can be live in 5 minutes. If you're using Advanced, give yourself 20-30 minutes.

## What you'll learn

- How to create a campaign in both Basic and Advanced
- How to choose the right keywords
- How to set bids and budgets
- What settings to use (and what to skip)
- What to expect in your first week

## Option A: Search Ads Basic (the fast track)

If you chose Basic, the process is delightfully simple:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select your app">
    Pick the app you want to promote from the dropdown.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set your monthly budget">
    Start with $100-500/month. You can change this anytime.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set your max CPI (Cost Per Install)">
    This is the maximum you're willing to pay per install. Apple suggests a range — start at or slightly below their suggestion.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose countries">
    Select the countries where you want your ads to appear. Start with your primary market.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch">
    That's it. Apple handles keywords, bidding, and targeting automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Basic is genuinely effective.** Many developers run Basic campaigns profitably for months without switching to Advanced. Don't feel pressured to upgrade unless you need more control.
</Tip>

## Option B: Search Ads Advanced (full control)

For those who want keyword-level control:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new campaign">
    Click **Create Campaign** > select your app > choose your campaign type (Search Results is the main one).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure campaign settings">
    - **Campaign name:** Use a descriptive name (e.g., "Brand Keywords - US")
    - **Budget:** Start with $500-1,000 total budget
    - **Daily cap:** Set to $15-25/day to control spending pace
    - **Locations:** Select your target countries/regions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an ad group">
    - **Ad group name:** Theme-based (e.g., "Exact - Brand Terms")
    - **Default max CPT bid:** Start with $0.50-1.00
    - **Audience:** Leave broad for now (or narrow by age/gender if you know your demo)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add keywords">
    Choose your targeting keywords (we'll cover strategy below). Add at least 10-20 keywords to start.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set match types">
    For each keyword, choose **Exact Match** or **Broad Match**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch">
    Review everything and hit **Start Campaign**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Keyword strategy

### The three keyword buckets

| Bucket | Examples | Priority |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Brand keywords** | Your app name, variations, common misspellings | Highest (defend your brand) |
| **Category keywords** | "meditation app," "budget tracker," "fitness app" | High (core audience) |
| **Competitor keywords** | Competitor app names | Medium (steal share) |

### Finding keywords

1. **Search Match** — Apple's auto-targeting that shows your ad for relevant queries. Turn it on for one ad group to discover new keywords.
2. **Keyword suggestions** — Apple suggests keywords in the campaign builder based on your app metadata.
3. **Competitor analysis** — Search the App Store for your category and note the top apps. Their names become your competitor keywords.

<Note>
  **Always run brand keywords as Exact Match.** You don't want competitors showing up when people search for your app. Bid high on your own brand terms — the CPI will be low because of high relevance.
</Note>

### Keyword match types

| Match Type | Example keyword | Shows for |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| **Exact Match** | "meditation app" | Only "meditation app" and close variants |
| **Broad Match** | "meditation app" | meditation app, mindfulness app, relaxation app, etc. |

### Recommended campaign structure

```
Campaign: US - All Keywords
├── Ad Group: Brand - Exact
│   Keywords: [your app name], [app name typos]
│   Bid: $1.00+ (defend aggressively)
├── Ad Group: Category - Exact
│   Keywords: [meditation app], [mindfulness app]
│   Bid: $0.75
├── Ad Group: Competitors - Exact
│   Keywords: [competitor names]
│   Bid: $0.50
└── Ad Group: Discovery - Search Match
    Keywords: None (Search Match ON)
    Bid: $0.50
    Purpose: Find new keywords automatically
```

## First-week expectations

| Day | What happens |
|-----|-------------|
| **Day 1** | Campaign starts delivering. Results may be slow at first. |
| **Day 2-3** | Impressions and taps start flowing. First installs come in. |
| **Day 4-7** | You have enough data to see which keywords perform. |
| **Week 2** | Pause underperforming keywords. Increase bids on winners. |

## Optimization quick tips

- **Check Search Match terms** — go to your Discovery ad group and find winning search terms. Add them as Exact Match in your other ad groups.
- **Raise bids on high-converting keywords** — if a keyword converts well but has low impression share, bid higher.
- **Add negative keywords** — any irrelevant terms from Search Match should become negatives.
- **Test Creative Sets** (Advanced only) — you can create custom ad variations using different screenshot sets to test what resonates.

<Warning>
  **Don't over-optimize in week 1.** Apple's algorithm also needs a bit of time to learn. Make initial adjustments after 7 days, then optimize weekly.
</Warning>
