    ## Search Ads Basic — the 5-minute campaign

    Basic is the fastest way to start advertising on the App Store. Apple handles keywords, bidding, and targeting. You just set your budget and go.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open Search Ads Basic dashboard">
        Go to [searchads.apple.com](https://searchads.apple.com) and make sure you are in the **Basic** dashboard (not Advanced). If you see a complex interface with campaigns and ad groups, click your name in the top-right corner and switch to Basic.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Click 'Promote this app'">
        Click the blue **Promote this app** button. If you have multiple apps, you will see all your apps listed. Click the one you want to promote.

        **If your app is not listed:** Make sure you signed in with the same Apple ID that manages the app in App Store Connect. If you used a different Apple ID, you need to be invited as a user in App Store Connect first.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Select your app">
        Click on the app you want to promote. You will see a preview of how your ad will look in search results. This is pulled directly from your App Store listing — your icon, name, subtitle, and screenshots.

        **Review this preview carefully.** If anything looks wrong (bad screenshot, outdated name), go fix it in App Store Connect first. You cannot customize the ad appearance in Basic.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Set your monthly budget">
        Apple asks for a **monthly budget** — the maximum you want to spend per month.

        **Recommended starting budgets:**
        | Your situation | Monthly budget |
        |---------------|---------------|
        | Just testing | $100 - $200 |
        | Small indie developer | $200 - $500 |
        | Serious about growth | $500 - $2,000 |
        | Scaling aggressively | $2,000 - $10,000 |

        The maximum monthly budget in Basic is $10,000 per app per country.

        <Tip>
          **Start small.** You can always increase later. $200/month is enough to learn whether Apple Search Ads works for your app.
        </Tip>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Set your max CPI (Cost Per Install)">
        This is the maximum amount you are willing to pay for a single install. Apple will show a **suggested range** based on your app's category and competition.

        **How to choose your max CPI:**

        1. Look at Apple's suggested range (e.g., $1.50 - $3.00)
        2. Start at or slightly below the middle of the range
        3. If you know your LTV (lifetime value per user), set your max CPI to 30-50% of LTV

        **Example:** If your app earns $5 per user over their lifetime, set your max CPI to $1.50 - $2.50.

        <Note>
          **You will usually pay less than your max CPI.** Apple's auction system means you pay just enough to win, not your maximum. Setting your max CPI to $2.00 might result in actual CPIs of $0.80 - $1.50.
        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Choose countries and regions">
        Select where you want your ads to appear. You can choose individual countries or regions.

        **Start with your primary market** — usually the country where most of your current users are. If you are unsure, start with:
        - **United States** — largest market, most expensive
        - **United Kingdom** — good market, moderate cost
        - **Canada** — English-speaking, moderate cost
        - **Australia** — English-speaking, moderate cost

        You can add more countries later.

        <Warning>
          **Each country is a separate campaign in Basic.** If you select 5 countries, Apple creates 5 independent campaigns, each with its own budget. A $500 monthly budget across 5 countries means $100 per country, which may be too thin.
        </Warning>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Review and launch">
        Review your settings:
        - App name
        - Monthly budget
        - Max CPI
        - Countries

        Click **Start Promoting**. Your campaign is now live.

        Apple starts showing your ad immediately (or within a few hours). You will see impressions, taps, and installs in the Basic dashboard within 24 hours.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### What happens behind the scenes in Basic

    When you launch a Basic campaign, Apple:

    1. Analyzes your app's metadata (title, subtitle, keywords, description)
    2. Identifies relevant search terms people use in the App Store
    3. Automatically bids on those search terms for you
    4. Adjusts bids in real time to stay within your max CPI
    5. Optimizes delivery to maximize installs within your budget

    You do NOT see which keywords Apple chose. You only see aggregate results: total impressions, taps, installs, spend, and average CPI.

    ### Managing your Basic campaign

    After launching, you can:
    - **Adjust your monthly budget** up or down
    - **Change your max CPI** if costs are too high or too low
    - **Pause or resume** the campaign
    - **Add or remove countries**

    That is the full extent of control in Basic. For more, switch to Advanced.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Search Ads Advanced (Full Control)">

    ## Search Ads Advanced — complete walkthrough

    Advanced gives you full control over keywords, bids, audiences, and creative. This walkthrough covers every screen and setting.

    ### Phase 1: Create the campaign

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open Search Ads Advanced dashboard">
        Go to [searchads.apple.com](https://searchads.apple.com) and make sure you are in the **Advanced** dashboard. You should see a navigation bar with Campaigns, Ad Groups, Keywords, etc.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Click 'Create Campaign'">
        Click the blue **Create Campaign** button in the top-right corner.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Select your app">
        Search for and select the app you want to promote. Type the app name or paste the App Store URL.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Choose the ad placement">
        Apple asks where you want your ad to appear:

        | Placement | Best for | Recommended for beginners |
        |-----------|---------|--------------------------|
        | **Search Results** | Direct response, installs | Yes — start here |
        | **Search Tab** | Brand awareness, broader reach | Not yet |
        | **Today Tab** | Premium brand awareness | Not yet |
        | **Product Pages** | Competitor conquesting | Not yet |

        Select **Search Results** for your first campaign. This is where the highest-intent users are.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Choose countries and regions">
        Select the countries where your ad should appear. Unlike Basic, you can create one campaign for multiple countries OR separate campaigns per country.

        **Recommendation:** Create separate campaigns per country (or per country group). This gives you independent budgets and performance data for each market.

        For your first campaign, pick one country — your primary market.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Name your campaign">
        Use a descriptive naming convention. You will have many campaigns eventually.

        **Good naming pattern:** `[Country] - [Strategy] - [Match Type]`

        Examples:
        - `US - Brand Defense - Exact`
        - `US - Category Keywords - Broad`
        - `UK - Discovery - Search Match`
        - `US - Competitors - Exact`

        For your first campaign, name it something like: `US - First Campaign` or `US - All Keywords`.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Set the campaign budget">
        This is the **total lifetime budget** for this campaign. Once it is spent, the campaign stops.

        | Your situation | Campaign budget |
        |---------------|----------------|
        | Testing | $500 |
        | Learning | $1,000 |
        | Growth mode | $5,000+ |

        You can increase this anytime, so start conservative.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Set the daily cap">
        The daily cap limits how much the campaign can spend per day. This controls the pace of spending.

        **Recommended starting daily caps:**
        - $15/day if testing cautiously
        - $25/day for moderate pace
        - $50/day if you want data fast

        <Note>
          **Daily cap math:** A $25/day cap means roughly $750/month in spend. Make sure your campaign budget and budget order can support this.
        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Assign to a campaign group (optional)">
        If you created campaign groups during account setup, assign this campaign to one. Otherwise, skip this.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Phase 2: Create an ad group

    After setting up the campaign, you create one or more ad groups within it. Ad groups contain your keywords and targeting settings.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Name the ad group">
        Use descriptive names that tell you what this ad group contains:
        - `Brand Terms - Exact Match`
        - `Category Keywords - Broad Match`
        - `Discovery - Search Match`

        For your first campaign, use: `All Keywords` or `General`.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Set the default max CPT (Cost Per Tap) bid">
        This is the maximum you will pay each time someone **taps** your ad. Not per install — per tap.

        **How to choose your starting CPT bid:**

        | Keyword type | Starting CPT bid |
        |-------------|-----------------|
        | Brand keywords (your name) | $1.00 - $2.00 |
        | Category keywords (generic) | $0.50 - $1.50 |
        | Competitor keywords | $0.50 - $1.00 |
        | Discovery / Search Match | $0.30 - $0.75 |

        Remember, you will typically pay LESS than your max bid (second-price auction). Start in the middle of the range and adjust after seeing data.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure audience targeting (optional but powerful)">
        This is where Advanced shines. You can narrow who sees your ads.

        **Demographics:**

        | Setting | Options | Recommendation |
        |---------|---------|----------------|
        | **Age** | 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65+ | Start with All Ages unless you know your audience |
        | **Gender** | Male, Female, All | Start with All unless your app is gender-specific |

        **Customer types:**

        This is one of the most powerful targeting features:

        | Customer type | Who they are | When to use |
        |-------------|-------------|-------------|
        | **All users** | Everyone | Default, broadest reach |
        | **New users** | People who have never downloaded your app | Growth campaigns |
        | **Returning users** | People who downloaded but deleted your app | Re-engagement |
        | **Users of my other apps** | People who use your other apps | Cross-promotion |

        <Tip>
          **For your first campaign, target "New users" only.** This avoids paying to re-acquire people who already have your app. You can create a separate "Returning users" campaign later with different messaging.
        </Tip>

        **Device types:**

        | Option | When to use |
        |--------|-------------|
        | **iPhone** | If your app is iPhone-optimized |
        | **iPad** | If your app has a great iPad experience |
        | **Both** | Default — reach everyone |
      </Step>
      <Step title="Set the ad group schedule (optional)">
        You can schedule the ad group to run on specific dates or days of the week. For your first campaign, leave this as "Run continuously" — you need data from all times to see patterns.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Phase 3: Add keywords

    This is the most important part of Advanced campaign setup. Keywords determine when your ad appears.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Understand match types first">
        Before adding keywords, understand the two match types:

        | Match type | How it works | Example |
        |-----------|-------------|---------|
        | **Exact Match** | Your ad shows ONLY when someone searches this exact term (and very close variations like plurals) | Keyword: `meditation app` shows for "meditation app" and "meditation apps" |
        | **Broad Match** | Your ad shows for the keyword AND related terms that Apple considers similar | Keyword: `meditation app` shows for "mindfulness app," "calm meditation," "relaxation app," etc. |

        **Notation:** Exact Match keywords are shown in [brackets]. Broad Match keywords have no brackets.

        <Warning>
          **Broad Match can be surprisingly broad.** Apple decides what is "related," and sometimes the matches are not great. Always monitor broad match terms and add negative keywords for irrelevant matches.
        </Warning>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Use Apple's keyword suggestions">
        In the keyword entry screen, Apple provides a **Recommended** tab with suggested keywords based on your app's metadata. This is a great starting point.

        Go through the suggestions and:
        1. Add relevant keywords
        2. Skip irrelevant ones
        3. Note the **popularity score** (higher = more search volume, but also more competition)
      </Step>
      <Step title="Add your brand keywords">
        Add your own app name and variations as Exact Match:

        ```
        [your app name]
        [your app name typo 1]
        [your app name typo 2]
        [your app abbreviation]
        ```

        **Why bid on your own name?** Because competitors will. If someone searches for your app and sees a competitor's ad first, you lose that install.

        Set a HIGH bid on brand keywords ($1.50 - $3.00). You will pay very little because your relevance is maximum.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Add category keywords">
        These are generic terms that describe what your app does:

        **For a meditation app:**
        ```
        [meditation app]
        [mindfulness app]
        [breathing exercises]
        [guided meditation]
        [sleep meditation]
        [anxiety relief app]
        [stress relief]
        [calm app]
        [relaxation app]
        [mental health app]
        ```

        Add these as both Exact Match and Broad Match in separate ad groups (or mix them in one ad group to start).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Add competitor keywords">
        Search the App Store for your category. Note the top 5-10 competing apps. Their names become your keywords:

        **For a meditation app:**
        ```
        [Headspace]
        [Calm]
        [Insight Timer]
        [Balance meditation]
        [Ten Percent Happier]
        ```

        <Note>
          **Competitor keywords are more expensive** because your app has lower relevance to someone else's name. Set moderate bids ($0.50 - $1.00) and monitor closely. Pause any competitor keyword that costs too much relative to its conversion rate.
        </Note>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Enable Search Match (for discovery)">
        Search Match is Apple's automatic keyword matching. When enabled, Apple will show your ad for search terms it considers relevant — even terms you did not add as keywords.

        **Enable Search Match in a dedicated ad group** with a lower bid ($0.30 - $0.50). This ad group acts as your keyword discovery engine. Check it weekly to find converting terms, then move those terms to your main ad groups as Exact Match.

        <Tip>
          **Crucial: Add all your existing keywords as negative keywords in the Search Match ad group.** This prevents Search Match from competing with your manual keywords. You want Search Match to only find NEW terms.
        </Tip>
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Phase 4: Add negative keywords

    Negative keywords prevent your ad from showing for specific searches. They are critical for controlling costs.

    **Campaign-level negative keywords:** Apply to all ad groups in the campaign.

    **Ad group-level negative keywords:** Apply only to that ad group.

    **When to add negative keywords:**
    - Before launch: Add obviously irrelevant terms
    - After launch: Check Search Match and Broad Match reports for irrelevant terms, then add them as negatives

    **Example negative keywords for a paid meditation app:**
    ```
    [free meditation]
    [free mindfulness]
    [meditation music]
    [meditation youtube]
    ```

    ### Phase 5: Set up Creative Sets (optional but recommended)

    Creative Sets let you create multiple ad variations using different combinations of your App Store screenshots and preview videos.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Make sure you have multiple screenshot sets">
        In App Store Connect, you should have screenshots for different device sizes. Creative Sets use these existing screenshots — you cannot upload new images specifically for ads.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Create a Creative Set in your ad group">
        In your ad group, go to the **Creative Sets** section and click **Create Creative Set**.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Choose screenshots">
        Select which screenshots and app previews to include in this variation. You can reorder them to test different leading screenshots.

        **Example:** Create two Creative Sets:
        - **Set A:** Screenshots 1, 2, 3 (your default order)
        - **Set B:** Screenshots 4, 1, 2 (leading with a different feature)
      </Step>
      <Step title="Monitor performance">
        After running for 1-2 weeks, check which Creative Set has a higher conversion rate. Pause the loser, create new variations to test.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Phase 6: Link custom product pages (optional)

    If you created custom product pages in App Store Connect, you can link them to specific ad groups.

    This means when someone taps your ad from a specific keyword group, they land on a custom App Store page tailored to their search.

    **Example:**
    - User searches "workout app" → sees your fitness-focused product page
    - User searches "nutrition tracker" → sees your food-tracking product page
    - Same app, but the landing page matches their intent

    To link:
    1. In your ad group settings, look for **Ad** or **Creative** section
    2. Select your custom product page from the dropdown
    3. The ad will automatically use the screenshots from that custom page

    ### Phase 7: Review and launch

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Review campaign settings">
        Verify:
        - Campaign name and budget
        - Daily cap
        - Countries
      </Step>
      <Step title="Review ad group settings">
        Verify:
        - Default CPT bid
        - Audience targeting
        - Device targeting
      </Step>
      <Step title="Review keywords">
        Verify:
        - All keywords added with correct match types
        - Negative keywords in place
        - Search Match enabled in discovery ad group
        - Individual keyword bids adjusted (if different from default)
      </Step>
      <Step title="Launch">
        Click **Start Campaign**. Your ad enters Apple's review (usually instant for search result ads) and begins serving.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Keyword research methodology

Finding the right keywords is the biggest factor in Apple Search Ads success. Here is a systematic approach.

### Step 1: Start with your app's metadata

Open App Store Connect and look at:
- Your **app name** and **subtitle**
- Your **keyword field** (100 characters, comma-separated)
- Your **app description**

List every term from these fields. These are your "seed keywords."

### Step 2: Expand with Apple's suggestions

In the Search Ads keyword entry screen, Apple suggests related keywords. Go through every suggestion and note:
- **Relevance** — is this actually related to your app?
- **Popularity** — higher numbers mean more search volume
- **Suggested bid** — higher bids mean more competition

### Step 3: Search the App Store manually

Open the App Store on your phone and type the beginning of category terms. Apple's autocomplete shows you what people actually search:

```
"medit..." → meditation app, meditation for sleep, meditation music
"mind..." → mindfulness app, mindfulness exercises, mindful breathing
"calm..." → calm app, calm music, calming games
```

Each autocomplete suggestion is a real search term that people use. Add relevant ones to your keyword list.

### Step 4: Research competitors

Search for your category in the App Store. Note the top 10 apps:
1. Their app names (potential competitor keywords)
2. Their subtitles (category keywords they target)
3. Their descriptions (more keyword ideas)

### Step 5: Use keyword research tools (optional)

Several third-party tools provide App Store keyword data:

| Tool | What it offers | Price |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **AppTweak** | Search volume, keyword suggestions, competitor analysis | From $69/month |
| **Sensor Tower** | Keyword intelligence, app rankings, market data | From $79/month |
| **AppFollow** | Keyword tracking, reviews monitoring | From $111/month |
| **SearchAds.com** | Apple Search Ads specific keyword tools | Free tier available |

<Tip>
  **You do not need paid tools to start.** Apple's built-in keyword suggestions and App Store autocomplete give you plenty of keywords for your first few months. Consider paid tools when you are spending $1,000+/month and need deeper competitive intelligence.
</Tip>

### Step 6: Organize keywords into buckets

Take your full keyword list and organize into categories:

| Bucket | Keywords | Match type | Bid level |
|--------|---------|------------|-----------|
| **Brand** | Your app name, variations, typos | Exact Match | High ($1.50+) |
| **Category - Head** | Top 5-10 most popular category terms | Exact Match | Medium-High ($0.75 - $1.50) |
| **Category - Long tail** | Specific, niche category terms | Exact Match | Medium ($0.50 - $1.00) |
| **Competitor** | Top 5-10 competitor app names | Exact Match | Medium ($0.50 - $1.00) |
| **Discovery** | None (Search Match) | Search Match | Low ($0.30 - $0.50) |

## Recommended campaign structure for beginners

Here is the exact structure to build for your first Advanced setup:

```
Campaign: [Country] - Brand Defense
├── Ad Group: Brand - Exact Match
│   ├── Keywords: [your app name], [your app typos]
│   ├── Default CPT bid: $1.50
│   ├── Search Match: OFF
│   └── Negative keywords: none needed
│
Campaign: [Country] - Category
├── Ad Group: Category - Exact Match
│   ├── Keywords: [meditation app], [mindfulness app], etc.
│   ├── Default CPT bid: $1.00
│   ├── Search Match: OFF
│   └── Negative keywords: your brand terms
│
├── Ad Group: Category - Broad Match
│   ├── Keywords: meditation, mindfulness, relaxation
│   ├── Default CPT bid: $0.75
│   ├── Search Match: OFF
│   └── Negative keywords: all exact match terms + brand terms
│
Campaign: [Country] - Competitors
├── Ad Group: Competitor Names - Exact Match
│   ├── Keywords: [Headspace], [Calm], etc.
│   ├── Default CPT bid: $0.75
│   ├── Search Match: OFF
│   └── Negative keywords: your brand terms
│
Campaign: [Country] - Discovery
└── Ad Group: Search Match Discovery
    ├── Keywords: NONE
    ├── Default CPT bid: $0.50
    ├── Search Match: ON
    └── Negative keywords: ALL keywords from all other campaigns
```

<Note>
  **Why 4 campaigns instead of 1 campaign with 4 ad groups?** Separate campaigns give each strategy its own daily budget. If brand keywords are cheap and category keywords are expensive, you do not want one strategy eating the other's budget.
</Note>

## First-week guide

### Day 1: Launch day

- Launch all campaigns
- Set conservative daily caps ($15-25/day per campaign)
- Do NOT make changes — let the data flow

### Day 2-3: Early signals

- Check that impressions are flowing (if not, your bids might be too low)
- Look at tap-through rates — if below 5%, your app listing may need work
- Do NOT pause or change anything yet

### Day 4-7: First meaningful data

After 4-7 days, you should have enough data to see patterns:

| What to check | What to do |
|---------------|-----------|
| **Keywords with 0 taps after 1,000+ impressions** | Your ad is not compelling for that term. Pause or lower bid. |
| **Keywords with taps but 0 installs after 20+ taps** | The App Store page is not converting for that audience. Consider the keyword's relevance. |
| **Keywords with installs at a good CPI** | These are winners. Increase their bids by 10-20% to get more volume. |
| **Search Match terms in your discovery ad group** | Review every search term. Move winners to your exact match ad groups. Add losers as negative keywords. |

### Week 2: First optimization

- Pause keywords that have spent $20+ with zero installs
- Increase bids on keywords with a CPI below your target
- Move winning Search Match terms to exact match ad groups
- Add negative keywords for irrelevant Search Match discoveries
- Check Creative Sets — is one outperforming?

<Warning>
  **Do NOT over-optimize in the first week.** Apple's algorithm needs time to learn. Making big changes too early restarts the learning process. Follow the schedule above: observe for 7 days, then make measured changes.
</Warning>

## Bid strategy deep dive

### How to think about bids

Your CPT (Cost Per Tap) bid is not what you pay — it is the **maximum** you are willing to pay. The actual cost is determined by the auction (second-price).

**The formula for deciding bids:**

```
Max CPT bid = Target CPI x Expected conversion rate

Example:
- You want to pay at most $2.00 per install (target CPI)
- Your conversion rate is 50% (half the people who tap will install)
- Max CPT bid = $2.00 x 0.50 = $1.00
```

### Bid adjustments over time

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Keyword CPI is below target and impression share is high | Keep bid as-is (it is working) |
| Keyword CPI is below target but impression share is low | Increase bid by 10-20% to win more auctions |
| Keyword CPI is at target | Monitor, no changes needed |
| Keyword CPI is above target | Decrease bid by 10-20% |
| Keyword has spent 2x your target CPI with zero installs | Pause the keyword |

### What is impression share?

Impression share tells you what percentage of available impressions you are winning. If your impression share is 30%, you are winning 30 out of every 100 available auctions. To increase impression share, raise your bid.

## Advanced optimization techniques

Once your campaigns are running and you have 2-4 weeks of data, consider these optimizations:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Graduated keyword management">
    Run this process weekly:
    1. Check Search Match ad group for new converting terms
    2. Add winning terms as Exact Match in your category or competitor ad groups
    3. Add the same terms as Exact Match negative keywords in Search Match
    4. This ensures each keyword is managed in the right ad group with the right bid
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Dayparting (time-based bidding)">
    After 4+ weeks of data, check your performance by hour of day. If installs are cheaper at certain times, use ad scheduling to focus budget on those hours.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Audience layering">
    Create duplicate ad groups with different audience settings:
    - One for ages 18-34
    - One for ages 35+

    After two weeks, see which age group converts better and at what cost. Allocate more budget to the winner.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Custom Product Page testing">
    Create 2-3 custom product pages in App Store Connect with different screenshot orders or messaging. Assign each to a different ad group. Measure which landing page has the highest conversion rate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Geographic expansion">
    Once you are profitable in your primary market, duplicate your campaign structure in new countries. Start with English-speaking markets (UK, Canada, Australia), then expand to Europe and Asia. Costs are typically 30-70% lower outside the US.
  </Accordion>

## Common mistakes to avoid

| Mistake | Why it hurts | What to do instead |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Bidding too low** | You win no auctions and get no data | Start at Apple's suggested bid, then optimize down |
| **Not defending brand keywords** | Competitors steal your organic traffic | Always run a brand campaign with high bids |
| **One giant ad group with all keywords** | Cannot control bids or budgets per strategy | Separate into brand, category, competitor, discovery |
| **Ignoring Search Match negatives** | You pay for irrelevant searches | Review Search Match terms weekly and add negatives |
| **Not optimizing App Store page first** | Low conversion rate wastes your ad spend | Fix screenshots and metadata before spending on ads |
| **Changing bids every day** | Algorithm never stabilizes | Make changes weekly, not daily |
| **Setting daily cap too low** | Too little data to optimize | At least $15/day per campaign |
| **Running only Broad Match** | Lots of irrelevant matches, hard to optimize | Start with Exact Match, add Broad Match for discovery |

## Measuring success

| Metric | Good | Average | Needs work |
|--------|------|---------|-----------|
| **TTR (Tap-Through Rate)** | 10%+ | 5-10% | Below 5% |
| **CR (Conversion Rate)** | 55%+ | 40-55% | Below 40% |
| **CPI (Cost Per Install)** | Below LTV target | At LTV target | Above LTV target |
| **Impression Share** | 50%+ for brand | 20-50% for category | Below 10% |

<Tip>
  **What is LTV?** Lifetime Value — the total revenue one user generates over their time using your app. If your LTV is $5, your CPI should be below $5 to be profitable. Ideally, your CPI is 30-50% of LTV to leave room for other costs.
</Tip>

## Next steps

Once your Apple Search Ads are running profitably:

1. **Scale** — increase budgets on winning campaigns
2. **Expand** — add new countries, new keywords, new match types
3. **Optimize** — test Creative Sets, custom product pages, audience segments
