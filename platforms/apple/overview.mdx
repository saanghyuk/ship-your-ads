## The easiest win in app advertising

Apple Search Ads shows your app at the top of App Store search results — right when someone is looking for an app to download. There's no higher-intent moment in mobile advertising.

Think about it: the user is already in the App Store, already searching, already ready to download. Your ad just needs to make your app the obvious choice.

## What you'll learn

## Basic vs. Advanced

Apple offers two tiers:

| Feature | Search Ads Basic | Search Ads Advanced |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Setup time** | 5 minutes | 30 minutes |
| **Keyword control** | Apple chooses | You choose |
| **Audience targeting** | None | Age, gender, location, device |
| **Bidding** | Automatic (set max CPI) | Manual (CPT bids) |
| **Reporting** | Basic dashboard | Full keyword-level reporting |
| **Best for** | Beginners, small budgets | Scaling, detailed optimization |
| **Min. budget** | $5/day | $5/day |

<Tip>
  **Start with Basic.** Seriously. Set a max CPI you're comfortable with, pick your countries, and Apple handles the rest. You can always upgrade to Advanced later when you need more control.
</Tip>

## How the auction works

Apple Search Ads uses a **second-price auction**:

1. User searches "meditation app" in the App Store
2. Apple evaluates all advertisers bidding on that term
3. The winner pays **one cent more than the second-highest bid** (not their max bid)
4. Your ad appears as the top search result, marked with a blue "Ad" label

**Relevance matters too.** Apple won't show your fitness app for "photo editor" searches, even if you bid high. Your app's metadata (title, subtitle, keywords) must be relevant to the search.

## Typical performance

| Metric | Average Range |
|--------|-------------|
| **Tap-Through Rate (TTR)** | 5-15% |
| **Conversion Rate** | 40-60% |
| **Cost Per Tap (CPT)** | $0.30 - $1.50 |
| **Cost Per Install (CPI)** | $0.50 - $3.00 |

<Note>
  These numbers are significantly better than other ad platforms because of the high intent. A user who clicks on an App Store search ad is much more likely to install than someone scrolling Instagram.
</Note>

## Requirements

Before you start, you need:

- A live iOS app in the App Store
- An Apple ID (ideally the one that owns the app)
- A credit or debit card for payment
- Your app's App Store page optimized (this IS your ad creative)
