## The intent machine

Meta finds people who *might* want your app. Google finds people who are **actively looking for it.** That's the fundamental difference, and it's a powerful one.

When someone searches "best budget app" or "habit tracker for beginners," they're telling Google exactly what they need. Google Ads lets you show up at that exact moment.

## Google Ads campaign types

<Tip>
  **For app developers, start with App Campaigns (Universal App Campaigns / UAC).** They're specifically designed for app installs, and Google automates most of the targeting and bidding. You just provide creative assets and a budget.

## How Google Ads differ from Meta

| **Creative focus** | Ad copy and keywords | Visual creative and video |
| **Learning curve** | Medium-high | Medium |
| **Minimum budget** | $10/day recommended | $5/day minimum |

## What to expect

| Timeline | What happens |
|----------|-------------|
| **Week 1** | Account setup, conversion tracking, first campaign launched |
| **Week 2-3** | Google's algorithm learning which queries and placements work |
| **Week 4+** | Data stabilizes, optimization begins |
| **Month 2+** | You can test additional campaign types |

## Typical costs

| Campaign Type | Cost Range | Metric |
|--------------|-----------|--------|
| App Campaigns | $0.50 - $4.00 | Per install |
| Search Ads | $0.50 - $3.00 | Per click |
| Display Ads | $0.50 - $2.00 | Per click |

  Google Ads costs vary widely by industry and competition. Finance and insurance keywords can cost $10+ per click, while niche app categories might be under $1. These ranges are general guidelines for app advertising.
