## Catch people at the moment of need

Search Ads are the original Google ad format, and they're still one of the most effective. When someone types "best meditation app" into Google, your ad can be the first thing they see. That's **intent-based advertising** at its finest.

## What you'll learn

- How Google Search Ads work (the auction system)
- How to research and choose keywords
- How to write effective search ad copy
- How to structure ad groups for maximum relevance
- How to set bids and budgets

## How Search Ads work

```
User searches "habit tracker app"
    → Google runs an instant auction among advertisers targeting that keyword
        → Winners' ads appear at the top of search results
            → User clicks → you pay (Cost Per Click)
```

Your position in the auction depends on two things:
1. **Your bid** — how much you're willing to pay per click
2. **Your Quality Score** — how relevant your ad is to the search query

<Note>
  You don't always need the highest bid to win. A highly relevant ad with a good Quality Score can beat a higher bidder. Google rewards relevance because it keeps users happy.
</Note>

## Keyword research

Keywords are the foundation of Search Ads. You need to find the terms people use when looking for apps like yours.

### Where to find keywords

1. **Google Keyword Planner** (free in Google Ads) — shows search volume and competition
2. **Google Search** — type your app category and see autocomplete suggestions
3. **App Store Search** — what terms do competing apps rank for?
4. **Your own intuition** — what would *you* search for?

### Keyword types

| Match Type | Symbol | Example | Shows ads for |
|-----------|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Broad Match** | none | budget app | budget app, money tracker, finance tool, etc. |
| **Phrase Match** | "..." | "budget app" | best budget app, budget app free, etc. |
| **Exact Match** | [...] | [budget app] | budget app (and very close variants) |

<Tip>
  **Start with Phrase Match and Exact Match.** Broad match casts too wide a net for beginners and can burn through budget quickly on irrelevant searches. You can expand to broad match later once you have conversion data.
</Tip>

### Keyword strategy for apps

Group your keywords into categories:

| Category | Examples | Intent Level |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Direct** | "habit tracker app," "download habit app" | Highest |
| **Problem** | "how to build habits," "stop procrastinating" | High |
| **Competitor** | "[competitor name] alternative" | High |
| **Category** | "best productivity apps," "top self-improvement apps" | Medium |

## Writing search ad copy

Google Search Ads have specific components:

```
Headline 1 | Headline 2 | Headline 3
Description line 1
Description line 2
Display URL
```

### Ad copy formula

```
Headline 1: [What it is] — "HabitFlow - Habit Tracker App"
Headline 2: [Key benefit] — "Build Better Habits in 5 Min/Day"
Headline 3: [CTA] — "Download Free Today"

Description: [Pain point + solution + social proof]
"Struggling to stick to new habits? HabitFlow makes it easy with
daily reminders, streaks, and a supportive community. Join 100K+ users."
```

### Responsive Search Ads (RSAs)

Google now primarily uses **Responsive Search Ads**, where you provide multiple headlines and descriptions, and Google tests combinations:

- Provide **10-15 headlines** (varied angles: features, benefits, CTAs, social proof)
- Provide **4 descriptions** (different value propositions)
- Google will test combinations and show the best performers

## Ad group structure

Organize your keywords into tightly themed ad groups:

```
Campaign: App Installs - Search
├── Ad Group: Direct Keywords
│   Keywords: "habit tracker app", "habit tracking app", "daily habit app"
│   Ads: Focused on app features
├── Ad Group: Problem Keywords
│   Keywords: "how to build habits", "stick to new habits"
│   Ads: Focused on solving the problem
└── Ad Group: Competitor Keywords
    Keywords: "[competitor] alternative", "apps like [competitor]"
    Ads: Focused on differentiation
```

<Warning>
  **Don't dump all your keywords into one ad group.** Each ad group should have a tight theme so your ads can be highly relevant to the keywords. Relevance = higher Quality Score = lower costs.
</Warning>

## Bidding strategies

| Strategy | How it works | Best for |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Maximize Conversions** | Google sets bids to get the most conversions within budget | Beginners with conversion tracking |
| **Target CPA** | Google targets a specific cost per conversion | When you know your target CPI |
| **Manual CPC** | You set bids for each keyword manually | Full control (advanced) |
| **Maximize Clicks** | Google gets you the most clicks within budget | When you want traffic fast |

<Tip>
  **Start with "Maximize Conversions"** and let it run for 2-3 weeks. Once you have enough conversion data (30+ conversions), switch to **Target CPA** with your desired cost per install.
</Tip>

## Negative keywords: save your budget

Negative keywords prevent your ads from showing on irrelevant searches. Add these immediately:

- "free" (if your app is paid)
- "review" (people looking for reviews, not installs)
- "jobs" / "salary" / "careers" (wrong intent)
- Competitor names you don't want to target
- Unrelated keywords that share terms with yours

Review your **Search Terms Report** weekly and add irrelevant terms as negative keywords.
