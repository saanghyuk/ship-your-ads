## Reach people everywhere they browse

Google's Display Network spans over **35 million websites and apps**, reaching more than 90% of internet users. Display Ads let you show visual ads (images, banners, responsive ads) to people as they read articles, check email, watch videos, and use apps.

## What you'll learn

- How Google Display Ads work and where they appear
- The different Display ad formats and sizes
- How to set up targeting (audiences, topics, placements)
- How to create effective display ad creative
- When to use Display vs. Search vs. App Campaigns

## Where Display Ads appear

Your ads can show across:

- **Websites** — news sites, blogs, forums, and content sites
- **Apps** — within other mobile apps via the AdMob network
- **Gmail** — in the Promotions tab
- **YouTube** — banner and overlay ads
- **Google Discover** — in the feed on Android and Google app

<Note>
  Display Ads are interruptive by nature — people aren't searching for your app, they're doing something else. Your creative needs to stop the scroll and earn attention. Think of them like mini billboards.
</Note>

## Display ad formats

| Format | Size | Where it works best |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| **Responsive Display Ads** | Google auto-sizes | Everywhere (recommended default) |
| **Image Ads** | 300x250, 728x90, 160x600 | Websites with standard ad slots |
| **App Promotion Ads** | Auto-generated | App install campaigns |
| **Video Ads** | Various | YouTube and video partners |

<Tip>
  **Use Responsive Display Ads.** You provide images, headlines, descriptions, and your logo. Google automatically creates ads in every size and format needed. It's less work and usually performs as well as custom-designed banners.
</Tip>

### Responsive Display Ad assets

You'll need to upload:

- **Images:** At least 3 landscape (1200x628) and 3 square (1200x1200)
- **Logo:** 1 landscape (1200x300) and 1 square (1200x1200)
- **Headlines:** Up to 5 (30 characters each)
- **Long headline:** 1 (90 characters)
- **Descriptions:** Up to 5 (90 characters each)

## Targeting options

Display Ads offer several targeting methods:

  <Card title="Audience Targeting" icon="users">
    **Affinity audiences:** People with specific interests (fitness enthusiasts, tech early adopters)

    **In-market audiences:** People actively researching products in a category

    **Custom audiences:** People who've searched for specific terms on Google
  </Card>
  <Card title="Content Targeting" icon="newspaper">
    **Topics:** Show ads on pages about specific topics (technology, health, finance)

    **Placements:** Hand-pick specific websites or apps

    **Keywords:** Show ads on pages containing specific keywords
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Recommended targeting approach

| Stage | Targeting | Why |
|-------|----------|-----|
| **Starting out** | In-market + affinity audiences | Broad but relevant |
| **With data** | Custom audiences (your search terms) | More targeted |
| **Retargeting** | Remarketing lists (past visitors/users) | Highest conversion rate |
| **Scaling** | Similar audiences + topic targeting | Maximum reach |

<Warning>
  **Avoid "optimized targeting" when you're learning.** Google will expand beyond your chosen audiences if it thinks it can find more conversions. This can work well, but it makes it hard to understand what's working. Turn it off until you're comfortable.
</Warning>

## Display Ads vs. other campaign types

| | Search Ads | Display Ads | App Campaigns |
|--|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **User intent** | High (searching) | Low (browsing) | Mixed |
| **Cost per click** | Higher ($0.50-3) | Lower ($0.10-1) | Varies |
| **Conversion rate** | Higher | Lower | Medium |
| **Best for** | Direct response | Awareness + retargeting | App installs |
| **Creative** | Text-only | Visual (images/video) | Multiple formats |
| **Control** | High | Medium | Low (automated) |

## Creating effective display creative

Since Display Ads interrupt people, your creative needs to work hard:

### The 3-second rule

Your ad must communicate its message in 3 seconds or less. That means:

1. **One clear visual** — show your app or its key benefit
2. **Minimal text** — 5-7 words maximum on the image
3. **Bold contrast** — stand out from the page content
4. **Clear CTA** — tell people exactly what to do

### What works for app ads

- Screenshots of your app in action
- Before/after comparisons
- Social proof ("500K+ downloads")
- Simple animations or GIFs (where supported)
