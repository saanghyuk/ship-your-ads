## The optimization mindset

Google Ads rewards precision. Unlike Meta where creative does most of the heavy lifting, Google optimization is about **finding the right keywords, writing relevant ads, and bidding strategically.** Small improvements compound into significant cost savings.

## What you'll learn

- Key Google Ads metrics and what they mean
- How to optimize Search campaigns (keywords, ads, bids)
- How to optimize Display campaigns (placements, audiences, creative)
- How to improve Quality Score
- Automation and bidding strategies for scale

## Key metrics to track

| Metric | What it means | Search target | Display target |
|--------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| **CTR** | Click-through rate | > 3% | > 0.5% |
| **CPC** | Cost per click | Varies | < $1 |
| **Conversion Rate** | Clicks that become installs | > 10% | > 2% |
| **CPA / CPI** | Cost per acquisition/install | Varies | Varies |
| **Quality Score** | Google's relevance rating (1-10) | > 7 | N/A |
| **Impression Share** | % of available impressions you won | > 70% | N/A |
| **ROAS** | Revenue per ad dollar | > 1.0 | > 1.0 |

## Search campaign optimization

### 1. Keyword optimization

Your most impactful lever. Review keywords weekly:

**Search Terms Report** — shows actual queries that triggered your ads

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review search terms">
    Go to **Keywords** > **Search Terms**. Look for irrelevant queries eating your budget.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add negative keywords">
    Any irrelevant search term becomes a negative keyword. Be aggressive here — it's the fastest way to reduce wasted spend.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Promote good terms">
    High-performing search terms that aren't in your keyword list? Add them as exact match keywords for more control.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pause underperformers">
    Keywords with lots of clicks but zero conversions after 2 weeks? Pause them.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Quality Score improvement

Quality Score directly affects your costs. A score of 8+ can lower your CPC by 30-50%.

| Factor | Weight | How to improve |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Ad relevance** | ~25% | Include keywords in your ad headlines and descriptions |
| **Expected CTR** | ~40% | Write compelling ads that earn clicks |
| **Landing page experience** | ~35% | Fast, relevant, mobile-friendly landing page |

<Tip>
  **The #1 way to improve Quality Score:** make sure each ad group has tightly themed keywords AND ads that mention those keywords. If your ad group targets "meditation app," your headline should say "meditation app."
</Tip>

### 3. Ad copy optimization

- Run at least 2 Responsive Search Ads per ad group
- Review the **Ad Strength** indicator (aim for "Good" or "Excellent")
- Pin your best-performing headline to Position 1
- Replace underperforming assets every 2-4 weeks

## Display campaign optimization

### 1. Placement review

This is the most important Display optimization:

- Review **Where Ads Showed** report weekly
- Exclude low-quality sites (parked domains, made-for-ads sites)
- Exclude apps where kids accidentally click (game apps are notorious)
- Double down on placements with high conversion rates

### 2. Audience refinement

- Start with broad audience targeting
- After 2 weeks, check which audiences convert best
- Create new campaigns focused on top-performing audiences
- Use **remarketing lists** for your highest-converting campaigns

### 3. Creative refresh

Display ad fatigue happens fast:

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| CTR dropping over 2 weeks | New images/headlines needed |
| Frequency > 5 | Audience saturation — expand or refresh |
| High impressions, low conversions | Creative isn't compelling enough |

## Bidding optimization

### The bidding progression

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start: Maximize Conversions">
    Let Google learn which clicks convert. No target cost yet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="After 30+ conversions: Set a Target CPA">
    Switch to Target CPA bidding. Set your target at or slightly above your current average CPA.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Refine gradually">
    Lower your Target CPA by 10% every 2 weeks. Google will find ways to be more efficient.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scale: Increase budget on winners">
    Once CPA is stable, increase budget by 15-20% every 5-7 days.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Don't set Target CPA too aggressively.** If your current CPA is $5 and you set a target of $2, Google may dramatically reduce your traffic. Lower gradually.
</Warning>
