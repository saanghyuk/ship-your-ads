## Measure it or it didn't happen

Google's ad algorithm optimizes toward conversions — but only if it can see them. Without proper conversion tracking, Google is flying blind, and you're wasting money.

## What you'll learn

- The different conversion tracking options for Google Ads
- How to set up Firebase for app conversion tracking
- How to install the Google Tag for web conversions
- How to define and prioritize conversion events
- How to verify your tracking is working

## Tracking options for apps

| Method | Best for | Complexity |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **Firebase SDK** | Android and iOS apps | Medium |
| **Google Play integration** | Android only (installs) | Low |
| **Third-party SDK** (Adjust, AppsFlyer, etc.) | Multi-platform attribution | Medium-High |
| **Google Tag** | Websites and web apps | Low |

<Tip>
  **For most app developers, Firebase is the recommended approach.** It's free, integrates natively with Google Ads, and gives you analytics beyond just ad tracking. If you're already using a third-party MMP (like Adjust or AppsFlyer), you can use that instead.
</Tip>

## Setting up Firebase

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Firebase project">
    Go to [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com) and create a new project (or use an existing one). Enable Google Analytics when prompted.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your app to Firebase">
    Click **Add App** and follow the setup for iOS and/or Android. Download the config file:
    - **Android:** `google-services.json` → place in `app/` directory
    - **iOS:** `GoogleService-Info.plist` → place in your Xcode project
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the Firebase SDK">
    **Android (Gradle):**
    ```groovy
    implementation platform('com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:32.0.0')
    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-analytics'
    ```

    **iOS (Swift Package Manager):**
    Add `https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk` and select `FirebaseAnalytics`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link Firebase to Google Ads">
    In Firebase Console: **Project Settings** > **Integrations** > **Google Ads** > **Link**.

    In Google Ads: **Tools & Settings** > **Linked Accounts** > **Firebase** > confirm the link.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import conversion events">
    In Google Ads: **Tools & Settings** > **Conversions** > **New Conversion Action** > **App** > **Firebase**.

    Select the events you want to track as conversions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key events to track

Not every event should be a "conversion" in Google Ads. Mark only the events that represent real value:

| Event | Firebase Event Name | Track as conversion? |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|
| App Install | `first_open` | Yes |
| Sign Up | `sign_up` | Yes |
| Tutorial Complete | `tutorial_complete` | Maybe |
| Purchase | `purchase` | Yes (primary) |
| Add to Cart | `add_to_cart` | Optional |
| Level Complete | `level_up` | No (too frequent) |

<Note>
  **Set one "primary" conversion** that represents real business value — usually `purchase` or `sign_up`. Google Ads optimizes hardest toward your primary conversion. Having too many conversion types dilutes optimization.
</Note>

## Setting up Google Tag (for websites)

If you drive traffic to a website or landing page before the app store:

```html
<!-- Google Tag -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=AW-XXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'AW-XXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```

Track specific page actions as conversions:

```javascript
// Track when someone clicks "Download App"
gtag('event', 'conversion', {
  'send_to': 'AW-XXXXXXXXX/AbC123',
  'event_callback': function() {
    window.location = 'https://apps.apple.com/your-app';
  }
});
```

## Verifying your setup

### For Firebase
1. Enable **DebugView** in Firebase Console
2. Run your app and trigger events
3. Check that events appear in real-time in DebugView
4. Wait 24 hours, then verify events show in Google Ads under **Conversions**

### For Google Tag
1. Install the **Google Tag Assistant** Chrome extension
2. Visit your website and check for the tag firing
3. Trigger a test conversion and verify it in Google Ads

<Warning>
  **Firebase events can take up to 24 hours to appear in Google Ads.** Don't panic if you don't see them immediately. Use Firebase DebugView for real-time verification, and check Google Ads the next day.
</Warning>

## Conversion tracking checklist

- [ ] Firebase (or third-party SDK) installed in your app
- [ ] Firebase project linked to Google Ads
- [ ] Key events defined and imported as conversions
- [ ] Primary conversion set (usually purchase or sign_up)
- [ ] Events verified in DebugView or Tag Assistant
- [ ] Google Tag installed on website (if applicable)
