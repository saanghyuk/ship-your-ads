## Setting up for success

Google Ads has a lot of settings. The good news is that most of them have sensible defaults. We'll walk through only the ones that matter and skip the noise.

## What you'll learn

- How to create your Google Ads account (and avoid the "Smart Campaign" trap)
- How to link your app via Google Play or Firebase
- How to configure billing and budget controls
- How to set up proper account structure
- How to grant team access

## Step 1: Create your Google Ads account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to ads.google.com">
    Visit [ads.google.com](https://ads.google.com) and click **Start Now**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Skip the guided setup">
    Google will try to walk you through creating your first campaign immediately. **Don't do this.** Look for "Switch to Expert Mode" or "Create an account without a campaign" at the bottom of the page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your account settings">
    - **Billing country:** Your business's country
    - **Time zone:** Your primary market's timezone (can't change later)
    - **Currency:** The currency you want to pay in (can't change later)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete account creation">
    Submit and confirm your email. You now have an Expert Mode Google Ads account.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Do NOT use "Smart Mode" or let Google auto-create your first campaign.** Smart campaigns give you almost zero control and make it hard to learn what's working. Always use Expert Mode.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Link your app

For app campaigns, Google needs access to your app listing:

### For Android (Google Play)
1. Go to **Tools & Settings** > **Linked Accounts**
2. Click **Google Play** > **Link**
3. Sign in with your Google Play developer account
4. Select the app you want to advertise

### For iOS (App Store)
1. Go to **Tools & Settings** > **Linked Accounts**
2. Click **Third-party app analytics** or set up **Firebase**
3. Add your iOS app using its App Store ID

<Note>
  **Android apps benefit the most from Google Ads** because of the direct Google Play integration. For iOS, consider pairing Google Ads with Apple Search Ads for the best coverage.
</Note>

## Step 3: Set up billing

1. Go to **Tools & Settings** > **Billing** > **Settings**
2. Add a payment method (credit card, debit card, or bank account)
3. Set your **billing threshold** — this is the amount at which Google charges you

### Budget safety tips

- Start with a **low daily budget** ($10-20) until you're comfortable
- Set up **budget alerts** in Billing to get notified at spending thresholds
- Review the **billing summary** weekly during your first month

<Tip>
  Unlike Meta, Google Ads doesn't have a global account spending limit. Your safety net is the daily campaign budget. Set it conservatively and increase only when you're ready.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Account structure

A clean account structure saves you headaches later:

```
Google Ads Account
├── Campaign: App Installs - US
│   ├── Ad Group: Broad keywords
│   └── Ad Group: Competitor keywords
├── Campaign: App Installs - EU
│   ├── Ad Group: English keywords
│   └── Ad Group: Local language keywords
└── Campaign: Retargeting - Global
    └── Ad Group: Past visitors
```

### Naming conventions

Use consistent, descriptive names:
```
[Type] - [Geo] - [Targeting] - [Date]
Example: UAC - US - Broad - 2026-02
Example: Search - UK - Competitor Keywords - 2026-02
```

## Step 5: Team access

1. Go to **Tools & Settings** > **Access and Security**
2. Click **+** to invite team members
3. Choose the right access level:

| Access Level | Can do | Best for |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| **Admin** | Everything + manage access | Account owner |
| **Standard** | Create/edit campaigns | Marketing team |
| **Read only** | View reports | Stakeholders |
| **Billing** | Manage payment settings | Finance team |

## Your setup checklist
